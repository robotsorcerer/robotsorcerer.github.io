### Mentoring 

I enjoy mentoring young students/scientists in teaching and research capacities alike. Before MSFT, I was an adjunct faculty at Brandeis up in Waltham, MA.

Current or past students include:

+ Leilei Cui. Tandon School of Engineering, NYU (Research Intern, 2022).
+ Jiangxi Xu. Columbia University (Research Intern, 2023).
+ Jason Choi. University of California, Berkeley (Research Intern 2023).
+ Shaoru Chen. Penn ESE, University of Pennsylvania, Microsoft Research Postdoc (2021-2023).
+ Akanksha Saran. Univeristy of Texas at Austin/Microsoft Research (2021-2023).
+  [Rachel Thompson](https://github.com/rsthomp), 2017 Undergraduate intern (MIT undergrad -> Brown University PhD).
+  [Ajith Venkateswaran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajithvenkateswaran), 2016-2017 Masters Intern, Senior Software Engineer at Johnson & Johnson.
+  [Adwait Kulkarn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adwaitkulkarni93), 2017-2018 Masters intern, (Senior Automotive Engineer, [Drov. Tech, MN](http://drovtech.com)).
+  [Blessing Kolawole](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blessingkolawole/), undergrad assistant. (CS PhD student, Tufts University).


#### [Old-ish] Teaching Keepsakes

~~I mostly teach a mixture of undergrad and graduate level classes in Robotics at Brandeis.~~

I have left Brandeis.

##### **In the words of my students:**

_"Thank you again Lekan. [Taking RBOT 250 with you] was quite a journey. But I feel more confident now with ROS because I figured all of the ROS system. I'll be looking forward to see you run the class again."_

_"Dr. Molu is very caring about his students. I love how he makes time for me to run over course notes, point out helpful reading materials, and work through problems together with me. I enjoy the examples and exercises he tasks us with."_

_"I want to thank Lekan for teaching this course, I definitely learned a lot. I am interested in auditing it when Lekan runs it again."_
