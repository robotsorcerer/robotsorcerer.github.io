The text below concerns the proof derived by Evans and Souganidis in their 1984 paper that related the "weaker" (or viscosity) solution to the _cauchy problem_ of HJ equations' lower value, viz.,

Specifically, equation 3.4 under Theorem 3.1  should read,

\begin{align}
  W(t,x) \ge \sup\_{y \in M(t)} \{ \int\_t^{t+\sigma} h \left(s, x(s), y(s), \delta \[y\](s) \right)  ds + V\left(t+\sigma, x(t+\sigma) \right) \} - \epsilon
\end{align}

and not

\begin{align}
  W(t,x) \ge \sup\_{y \in M(t)} \{ \int\_t^{t+\sigma} h \left(s, x(s), \delta \[y\](s) \right)  ds + V\left(t+\sigma, x(t+\sigma) \right) \} - \epsilon
\end{align}

The authors omitted the control term \\( y(s) \in Y \vert y \\)  is measurable.
