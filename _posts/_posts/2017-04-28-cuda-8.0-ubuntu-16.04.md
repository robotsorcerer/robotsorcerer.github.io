#### Introduction

NVIDIA libraries are notorious for breaking Xserver particularly in the ubuntu Linux distro. Here's my installation guide on how to do a clean install without breaking display drivers. Hope it helps.

#### Installation

Pull Ubuntu 8.0 from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/8.0/Prod2/local_installers/cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux-run)

- Add a `blacklist-nouveau.conf` file to your `etc/modprobe.d` directory like so:

```bash
  sudo touch /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf
```

- Add the following contents to the file you just created using your fave editor:

```bash
blacklist nouveau
options nouveau modeset=0
```

- Turn off X server

```bash
  sudo service lightdm stop
```

- Install Cuda 8.0

  - `cd` to the directory where the cuda install file was stored and run it with admin rights e.g.

  ```bash
  sudo ./cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux.run
  ```

  - Accept the EULA Licence agreement

  - Accept yes for NVIDIA drivers install

  - Accept yes for cuda-8.0 and cuda symlink

  - Decline the installation of OpenGL Libraries (this breaks Xserver)

  - Install Samples

  - Decline the installation of nvidia-xconfig (you wouldn't need it)

  - Reboot your system after installation

Voila! We're set to start developing with cuda.
