### Introduction

Git is a useful tool for remote/online work collaboration, as well as social coding. It is useful being able to share one's work among different computers using native git commands such as `merge`, `fetch`, `push`, `clone`, or `pull` without resolving to using `ssh`, or `scp` which are without the benefits of `diff` and `merge` strategies of `git`. More so, not everyone enjoys exposing their incomplete work/code to a remote repo for the sake of fetching to local `origins` on different computers. This post is meant to show how to go about these git ops strategies without going through a remote e.g. an http[s] server.

#### Pulling/Pushing git remotes from a LAN/WAN repo

As an example, suppose we have a repo named `sensors` in the `Documents` directory of a computer with username and group name `drumpf@dissembler` and we have a few commits ahead of a tracking repo on a computer named `robots@killem`, we can fetch and merge our recent commits on `drumpf@dissembler` into `robots@killem` as follows:

We could use `ssh`, `http[s]`, `ftp[s]` or `rsync` transport protocols. To pull updates from `drump@dissembler:~/Documents/sensors.git` to `robots@killem:~/Documents/sensors.git` repo, we would do one of the following:

  - via ssh:

    <pre class="terminal"><code>robots@killem:~/Documents/sensors$ git pull ssh://drumpf@dissembler:/~/Documents/sensors.git</code></pre>

  - via https:

      <pre class="terminal"><code>robots@killem:~/Documents/sensors$ git pull http[s]://drumpf@dissembler:/robots/killem/Documents/sensors.git</code></pre>

  - via ftp

      <pre class="terminal"><code>robots@killem:/home/drumpf/Documents/sensors$ git pull ftp[s]://drumpf@dissembler:/robots/killem/Documents/sensors.git</code></pre>

  - via rsync

      <pre class="terminal"><code>robots@killem:/home/drumpf/Documents/sensors$ git pull rsync://drumpf@dissembler:/~/Documents/sensors.git</code></pre>

Note that we have used user expansion for both `ssh` and `git`. `ftp[s]` and `rsync` do not allow user expansion when pulling, pushing or cloning, so the full path to the repo has to be specified.
The `https` syntax has no authentication and can be dangerous on unsecured networks. If the group names of the computers are not advertised by `/etc/hosts`, you can use the ip address of the computer in place of the host names. Note that `ftp[s]` can be used for fetching while `rsync` can be used for both fetching and pushing. Both are not very efficient, however, and they are actually deprecated; so you should refrain from using them as much as you can.

All the commands above would also work for `git push`.

**SCP-like syntaxes are valid as well:**

  <pre class="terminal"><code>scp [user@]host.ng:path/to/repo.git/</code></pre>

but note that the first character after the first column must not be a slash to help distinguish a local path from an ssh url

All of the above commands also support cloning `git` repos from one directory to another on the same host or between workstations on the same `LAN/WAN`. All that would need to change would be to replace the `LAN/WAN` hostname with the path we are cloning from. See examples below:

<a name="clone"></a>
#### Cloning git remotes from a LAN/WAN repo

The procedure is the same as above save we replace pull/push with clone, e.g

 -  <pre class="terminal"><code>git clone ssh://[you@]remote.ng[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</code></pre>

 -  <pre class="terminal"><code>git clone  git://remote.ng[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</code></pre>

 -  <pre class="terminal"><code>git clone  http[s]://remote.ng[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</code></pre>

 -  <pre class="terminal"><code>git clone  ftp[s]://remote.ng[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</code></pre>

 -  <pre class="terminal"><code>git clone rsync://remote.ng/path/to/repo.git/</code></pre>


 If when doing any of the operations specified so far, the transport protocol is not specified, no problem! Git assumes a remote url transport protocol if it does not know what the remote address is. So we could for example do

 <pre class="terminal"><code>robots@killem:~/Documents/sensors$ git push transport::address</code></pre>

 where `address` is the path to the repo on the LAN/WAN and transport is replaced by `https`.

 An alternative scp-like syntax is also valid when using the ssh protocol:

 -   <pre class="terminal"><code>git clone [you@]remote.ng:path/to/repo.git/</code></pre>

 Just as is the case for `pull/push`, `https` is not secure and should be used with caution.
