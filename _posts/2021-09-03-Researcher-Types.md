The above quote is attributed to Naira Hovakimyan, of \\(L\_1\\)-adaptive control fame. I would like to add that I think there are three types of researchers in every interdisciplinary field I've ever found myself. There ae the _'professional Professionals'_; the _'professional Un-professionals'_; and the _'un-professional Professionals'_. I'll explain:

### The Professional Professionals

These are the well-established researchers in a field of study. They've demonstrated lasting impact on their field throughout their career. They know the password to the locker and know how to apply the key combination in order to open the locker. In the physical sciences and engineering, these are the folks who can wield the theory and can demonstrate through numerical analysis, simulations, and hardware experiments that their ideas are worth their salt in the tastebuds. They never rest on their laurels. They continue to attend the conferences, interacting with junior and senior researchers alike with no regard for ego. They are approachable and are generally good mentors. They'll take a chance on the young _unprofessional professional_ (see below) and work with them in helping them coalesce their ideas into original thought. They are the crown jewel among researchers; and then there are the _professional unprofessionals_.

### The "Professional Un-Professionals"

I'm sure we've seen plenty of folks like these. They are very plenteous in the research community. I call them the "have-beens". They "used-to-be" good researchers. They used to be curious. They used to be on the bleeding edge. And then a little success came, they lost their compass, and started resting on their laurels: their h-indices, accolades, number of papers submitted each year to a publishing avenue. Their head swelled a little bit. When you try to collaborate with them, they give you a long lecture about how many years of experience they have, or how they are widely regarded in their field, or how they do not think your ideas are worth any while because they have been in this field from utero. These people should be avoided by young researchers like a plague. They have become trapped by the means of judging success as a researcher and have lost perspective as to the end of researcher; the why of doing what we do. If you must learn from them, keep your mental health in check.

### The Unprofessional Professionals

These are the ambitious young graduate school researchers, research assistants, postdocs, assistant professors. They are in the thick of the research forest; they know the chaff from the wind; and understand that the consensus currently being taken by the bandwagon is not the smartest way to solve the problem. Their ideas are wild and experts think they are "far-fetched". But they do not mind spending countless hours and possibly years working on problems that everybody should be working on, but are ignoring because they are difficult. They may be a little brash and with their rough edges, but with the right mentorship, they can be cultured into diplomatic speak as they continue to evolve in their career path. These are the future of the field. The professional professionals should actively seek them out and gently mentor them to do what they really _intended to do._
