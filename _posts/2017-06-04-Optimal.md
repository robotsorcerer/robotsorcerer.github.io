#### **The Problem of Bolza**

Suppose we have the following nonlinear dynamical system

\begin{equation}            \label{eq:system}
  \dot{x}  =f(x, u, t), \qquad \qquad x(t\_0) = x\_0
\end{equation}  

which starts at state, \\(x\_0\\) and time, \\(t\_0\\).

##### __Assumption I__

If the function \\(f(\centerdot)\\) is
continuously differentiable in all its arguments, then the initial value problem (IVP) of \eqref{eq:system} has a <u>unique solution</u> on a finite time interval; this is a sufficient assumption (Khalil, 1976).

##### __Assumption II__

\\(T\\) is sufficiently small enough to reside within the time interval where the system's solutions are defined.

Qualitatively, our goal is to **optimally** control the system when it starts in a state \\(x\_0\\), at a _fixed_ time \\(t\_0\\), to a neighborhood of the terminal manifold \\(T\\), whilst exerting as minimal a control energy as possible. Quantitatively, we can define this goal in terms of an index of performance evaluation defined thus:

\begin{equation}            \label{eq:cost}
  J = J(x(t\_0), u(\centerdot), t\_0)  = V(x(T)) + \int\limits_{t=t\_0}^{T} L\left(x(\tau), u(\tau), \tau\right)d\tau
\end{equation}  

With \\(L\left(x(\tau), u(\tau), \tau\right)\\) as the instantaneous cost and \\(V(x(T))\\) is essentially, the terminal cost -- both are nonnegative functions of their arguments. We can think of \\(J\\) as the total amount of actions we take (controls) and the state energy utilized in bearing the states from \\(x\_0\\) to a neighborhood of the terminal manifold where the cost \\(V(x(T)) = 0\\). In the above equation, the **initial time, \\(t\_0\\) is fixed**, and **the final time, \\(t\_f\\),  is a variable**. Problems of the form \eqref{eq:cost} that involve the cost on only the initial and final states are called **problems of Mayer**; those that involve only the integral or the running cost are **problems of Lagrange**; while those that are explicitly written out in the form of \eqref{eq:cost}  are the so-called **problems of Bolza**, and \\(J\\) is evaluated along the trajectories of the system \\(x(t)\\), based on an applied control \\(u(\centerdot)\|\_{t\_0 \le t \le T}\\).


|:--------------------:|:-------------------------:|
|     Mayer problem:    |    \\(J = x\_0(t\_f) + V(x(T), T); \qquad \dot{x}\_0 = f(x, u, t); x(T) = 0 \\).   |
|     Lagrange problem:     |    \\(J = \int\limits_{t=t\_0}^{T} L\left(x(\tau), u(\tau), \tau\right)d\tau; \qquad \dot{x} = 0; V(x(T), T) = 0 \\)   |

The question to ask then is that given the cost of performance index \\(J\\), how do we find a control law \\(u^\star\\) that is optimal along a unique state trajectory, \\(x^\star\\), in the interval \\([t\_0, T]\\)? This optimal cost would be the minimum of all the possible costs that we could possibly incur when we implement the optimal control law \\(u^\star\\). Mathematically, we can express this cost as:

\begin{gather}
  J^\star(x(t\_0), t\_0)  = \int\limits_{t=t\_0}^{T} L \left(x^{\star}(\tau), u^\star(\tau), \tau \right) d\tau + V(x^\star(T)) \\
                 = \min\_{ u\_{[t\_0, T]}} J(x\_0, u, t\_0)
\end{gather}


Therefore, the optimal cost is a function of the starting state and time so that we can write:

\begin{equation}
  J^\star(x(t\_0), t\_0) = \min\_{ u\_{[t\_0, T]}} J(x(t\_0), u(\centerdot), t\_0) = \min\_{ u\_{[t\_0, T]}} \int\limits_{t\_0}^{T} L\left(x(\tau), u(\tau), \tau\right)d\tau + V(x(T))
\end{equation}

Now, assume that we start at an arbitrary initial condition \\(x\\), at time \\(t\\), it follows that the optimal cost-to-go from \\(x(t)\\) to \\(x(T)\\) is (abusing notation and dropping the templated arguments in \\(J\\)):

\begin{equation}          \label{eq:cost-to-go}
  J^\star(x, t) = \min\_{ u\_{[t, T]}} \left[\int\limits_{t}^{T} L\left(x(\tau), u(\tau), \tau\right)d\tau\right] + V(x(T))
\end{equation}

Things get a little bit interesting when we splice up the integral kernel in \eqref{eq:cost-to-go} along two different time-paths, namely:

\begin{equation}        \label{eq:spliced}
  J^\star(x, t) = \min\_{ u\_{[t, T]}} \left[\int\limits_{t}^{t\_1} L\left(x(\tau), u(\tau), \tau\right)d\tau + \int\limits_{t\_1}^{t\_2} L\left(x(\tau), u(\tau), \tau\right)d\tau\right] + V(x(T))
\end{equation}

We can split the minimization over two time intervals, e.g.,  

\begin{equation}        \label{eq:two_mins}
  J^\star(x, t) = \min\_{ u\_{[t, t\_1]}} \min\_{ u\_{[t\_1, t\_2]}} \left[\int\limits_{t}^{t\_1} L\left(x(\tau), u(\tau), \tau\right)d\tau + \int\limits_{t\_1}^{t\_2} L\left(x(\tau), u(\tau), \tau\right)d\tau\right] + V(x(T))
\end{equation}

Equation \eqref{eq:two_mins} gives the beautiful intuition that one can divide the integration into two or more time slices, solve the optimal control problem for each time slice and in the overall, minimize the effective cost function \\(J\\) of the overall system. This in essence is a statement of [Richard E. Bellman][richard-bellman]'s principle of optimality:

> Bellman's Principle of Optimality: An optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are, the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with regard to the state resulting from the first decision.

> -- Bellman, Richard. Dynamic Programming, 1957, Chap. III.3.


With the principle of optimality, the problem takes a more intuitive meaning, namely that the cost-to-go from \\(x\\) at time \\(t\\) to a terminal state \\(x(T)\\) can be computed by minimizing the sum of the cost to go from \\(x = x(t)\\) to \\(x\_1 = x(t\_1)\\) and then, the  optimal cost-to-go from \\(x\_1\\) onwards.

Therefore, \eqref{eq:two_mins} can be restated as:

\begin{equation}        \label{eq:two_mins_sep}
  J^\star(x, t) = \min\_{ u\_{[t, t\_1]}} \left[\int\limits_{t}^{t\_1} L\left(x(\tau), u(\tau), \tau\right)d\tau +  \underbrace{\min\_{ u\_{[t\_1, t\_2]}} \int\limits_{t\_1}^{t\_2} L\left(x(\tau), u(\tau), \tau\right)d\tau + V(x(T))}_{J^\star(x\_1, \, t\_1)} \right]
\end{equation}

\\(J^\star(x\_1, \, t\_1)\\) in \eqref{eq:two_mins_sep} can be seen as the optimal cost-to-go from \\(x\_1\\) to \\(x(T)\\), so that the overall cost can be written as

\begin{equation}         \label{eq:optimal_pre}
  J^\star(x, t) = \min\_{ u\_{[t, t\_1]}} \left[\int\limits_{t}^{t\_1} L\left(x(\tau), u(\tau), \tau\right)d\tau +  J^\star(x\_1, \, t\_1)  \right]
\end{equation}

Replacing \\(t\_1\\) by \\(t + \delta t\\) and with the assumption that \\(J^\star(x, t)\\) is differentiable, we can expand \eqref{eq:optimal_pre} into a first-order Taylor series around \\((\delta t, x)\\) as follows:

\begin{equation}        \label{eq:taylor}
  J^\star(x, t) = \min\_{ u\_{[t, t + \delta t]}} \left[ L\left(x, u, \tau\right)\delta t  +  J^\star(x, \, t) + \left(\dfrac{\partial J^\star(x, t)}{\partial t}\right) \delta t + \left(\dfrac{\partial J^\star(x, t)}{\partial x} \right)^T \delta x + o(\delta)  \right]
\end{equation}

where \\(o(\delta)\\) denotes higher order terms satisfying \\(\lim\_{\delta \rightarrow 0}\dfrac{o(\delta)}{\delta} = 0\\).

Refactoring \eqref{eq:taylor}, we find that

\begin{equation}        \label{eq:hamiltonian_pre}
  \dfrac{\partial J^\star(x, t)}{\partial t}  = -\min\_{ u\_{[t, t + \delta t]}} \left[ L\left(x, u, \tau\right)  +   \left(\dfrac{\partial J^\star(x, t)}{\partial x} \right) \underbrace{\dot{x}(\centerdot)}_{f(x,u,t)}  \right],
\end{equation}

which is in some sense a statement of the [**Hamilton-Jacobi**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%E2%80%93Jacobi_equation#Mathematical_formulation) (HJ-) equation. As \\(L(x(t), u(t), t)\\) is a functional, the HJ equation is not precisely a partial differential equation (p.d.e) but a mixture of functionals and p.d.e's. We shall define the components in the square column of the above equation as the **Hamiltonian**, \\(H(\centerdot)\\) such that  \eqref{eq:hamiltonian_pre} can be thus rewritten:

\begin{equation}        \label{eq:hamiltonian}
  \dfrac{\partial J^\star(x, t)}{\partial t}  = -\min\_{ u\_{[t, t + \delta t]}} H\left(x, \nabla\_x J^\star (x, t), u, t \right)
\end{equation}

Based on the smoothness assumption of all function arguments in \eqref{eq:system},
when the linear sensitivity of the Hamiltonian to changes in \\(u\\) is zero, then
\\(\nabla H\_u\\) **must** vanish at the optimal point i.e.,

\begin{equation}      \label{eq:hamiltonian_deri}
  \nabla H\_u(x, \nabla\_x J^\star (x, t), u, t) = 0
\end{equation}

ensuring that we satisfy the **local optimality** property of the controller. In addition, if the Hessian of the Hamiltonian is positive definite along the trajectories of the solution, i.e.,

\begin{equation}   
  \dfrac{\partial^2 H}{\partial^2 u} > 0
\end{equation}

then we have the sufficient condition for global optimality. These conditions are referred to as the [Legendre-Clebsch][legendre-clebsch] conditions, essentially guaranteeing that over a singular arc, the Hamiltonian is minimized.


You begin to see the beauty of optimal control in that \eqref{eq:hamiltonian_deri} allows us to translate the complicated _functional minimization_ integral of \eqref{eq:cost} into a minimization problem that can be solved by ordinary calculus (i.e. a  _function minimization_ problem).
If we let

\begin{equation}      
  H^\star(x, \nabla\_x J^\star (x, t), t) = \min\_u \left[H(x, \nabla\_x J^\star (x, t), u, t)\right]
\end{equation}

then it follows that solving \eqref{eq:hamiltonian_deri} for the optimal \\(u = u^\star\\) and putting the result in \eqref{eq:hamiltonian}, one obtains the _**Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman**_ pde whose solution is the optimal cost \\(J^\star(x(t), t)\\) such that

\begin{equation}        \label{eq:optimal_cost}
  \dfrac{\partial J^\star(x, t)}{\partial t}  = -H^\star \left(x, \nabla\_x J^\star (x, t), u, t \right)
\end{equation}

We can introduce a boundary condition that assures that the cost function of \eqref{eq:cost} is well-posed viz,

\begin{equation}        \label{eq:boundary_cost}
  J^\star(x(T), T)  = V(x(T))
\end{equation}

Taken together, equations \eqref{eq:optimal_cost} and \eqref{eq:boundary_cost} allow us to analytically solve for the instantaneous `kinetic energy` of the cost function in \eqref{eq:cost} and \eqref{eq:boundary_cost}  allows us to solve for the boundary condition __that assure the sufficiency of an optimal control law to exist__. If we can solve for \\(u^\star\\) from \\(J^\star(x,t)\\), then \eqref{eq:boundary_cost} must constitute the optimal control policy for the nonlinear dynamical system in \eqref{eq:system} given the cost index \eqref{eq:cost}.

### **Optimality Conditions via Calculus of Variations**

We can also derive the necessary and sufficient conditions by performing calculus of variations on the cost function of \eqref{eq:cost} subject to the constraint on the final state (where I have replaced \\(T\\) by \\(t\_f\\)):

\begin{align}
\bar{V}(x(t\_f), t\_f)& = 0
\end{align}

with the smooth mapping \\(\bar{V}(x(t\_f), t\_f): \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^p\\). We can rewrite the equation of Bolza using Lagrange multipliers \\(\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^p, p(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n \\) as follows,

\begin{align} \label{eq:modified_cost}
  \tilde{J} = V(x(t\_f), t\_f) + \lambda^T \bar{V}(x(t\_f), t\_f) + \int\limits_{t=t\_0}^{t\_f} L \left[\left(x(\tau), u(\tau), \tau \right)  + p^T\left(f(x(\tau), u(\tau), \tau) - \dot{x}(\centerdot)\right)\right] d\tau
\end{align}

where by the _[Legendre transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_transformation)_, we may define the Hamiltonian as

\begin{align}
  H(x, p, u, t) = L(x, u, t) + p^T f(x, u, t).
\end{align}

Assuming independent variations in \\(\delta u(\centerdot), \delta x(\centerdot), \delta p(\centerdot), \delta \lambda \text{ and } \delta t\_f \\), the variation of \eqref{eq:modified_cost} becomes

\begin{align}
\delta \tilde{J} = \left(\dfrac{\partial V}{\partial x} + \dfrac{\partial \bar{V}^T}{\partial x}\lambda \right) \delta x|\_{t\_f} + \left(\dfrac{\partial V}{\partial t\_f} + \dfrac{\partial \bar{V}^T}{\partial t\_f}\lambda \right) \delta t|\_{t\_f} + \bar{V}^T \delta \lambda + \left(H-p^T \dot{x}\right) \delta t|\_{t\_f} + \nonumber
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\int\limits\_{t\_0}^{t^f} \left[ \dfrac{\partial H}{\partial x} \delta x + \dfrac{\partial H}{\partial u} \delta u  - p^T \delta \dot{x} + \left(\dfrac{\partial H^T}{\partial p} - \dot{x}\right)^T \delta p \right] d\tau
\end{align}

whereupon, integrating \\(\int p^T \delta\dot{x} d\tau\\) by parts, we find that

\begin{align}
\delta \tilde{J} = \left(\dfrac{\partial V}{\partial x} + \dfrac{\partial \bar{V}^T}{\partial x}\lambda -p^T\right) \delta x({t\_f}) + \left(\dfrac{\partial V}{\partial t\_f} + \dfrac{\partial \bar{V}^T}{\partial t\_f}\lambda + H\right) \delta t({t\_f}) + \bar{V}^T \delta \lambda  + \nonumber
\end{align}

\begin{align} \label{eq:cost-var}
\int\limits\_{t\_0}^{t^f} \left[ \left(\dfrac{\partial H}{\partial x} + \dot{p}^T \right) \delta x + \dfrac{\partial H}{\partial u} \delta u   + \left(\dfrac{\partial H^T}{\partial p} - \dot{x}\right)^T \delta p \right] d\tau.
\end{align}

And for the independent variations \\(\delta \lambda, \delta x, \delta u, \delta p \\), an optimal value of the modified cost \\(\tilde{J}\\) occurs when \eqref{eq:cost-var} becomes zero i.e. \\(\tilde{J}=0\\), so that we have the following for the **necessary conditions for optimality**:


|        Variation             |       Name           |  Equation                     |
|:------------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
 |   \\(\delta \lambda \\)  |    Final state constraint  | \\(\bar{V}(x(t\_f), t\_f) = 0\\)     |
|    \\(\delta p \\)   |    State Equation | \\(\dot{x} = \dfrac{\partial H^T}{\partial p} \triangleq f(x, u, t)  \\)      |
 |    \\(\delta x \\)   |    Co-state Equation | \\(\dot{p} = -\dfrac{\partial H^T}{\partial x}\\)      |
|    \\(\delta u \\)   |    Input stationarity | \\(\dfrac{\partial H}{\partial u}  =0\\)       |
 |    \\(\delta x\|\_{t\_f} \\)   |    Boundary cond.              | \\(\dfrac{\partial V}{\partial x} - p^T = -\dfrac{\partial \bar{V}^T}{\partial x} \lambda\|\_{t\_f} \\)     |
 |    \\(\delta t\_f \\)     |    Boundary cond.               | \\(H + \dfrac{\partial V}{\partial t\_f} = -\dfrac{\partial \bar{V}^T}{\partial t\_f} \lambda \|\_{t\_f}\\)   |

These necessary conditions may be split into the following categories viz.,

Optimality conditions:

\begin{align}
  \dot{x} = \dfrac{\partial H^T}{\partial p} \nonumber
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  \dot{p} = -\dfrac{\partial H^T}{\partial x}.
\end{align}

Stationarity condition:

\begin{align}
   \dfrac{\partial H (x, u^\star, p)}{\partial u}  = 0.
\end{align}

Terminal Constraint:
\begin{align}
   \bar{V}(x(t\_f, t\_f))  = 0.
\end{align}

And the transversality condition:

\begin{align}
   \dfrac{\partial V}{\partial x} - p^T = -\dfrac{\partial \bar{V}^T}{\partial x} \lambda\|\_{t\_f}   \nonumber
\end{align}

\begin{align}
   H + \dfrac{\partial V}{\partial t\_f} = -\dfrac{\partial \bar{V}^T}{\partial t\_f} \lambda \|\_{t\_f}.
\end{align}

To find the sufficient condition, we can do a second variation on \\(\tilde{J} \\), but given the messiness, we can use the necessary conditions to guide us in finding the **sufficient condition for local minimality** of, say, a trajectory's \\( (x^\star(\centerdot), u^\star(\centerdot), p^\star(\centerdot))\\) local minimum. Essentially, as before **local minimality** requires that the Hessian of the Hamiltonian,

\begin{align} \label{eq:Hessian}
  \dfrac{ \partial^2 H(x^\star, u^\star, p^\star, t)}{\partial u}
\end{align}
%
 be positive definite along the optimal trajectory. A **sufficient condition** is to require **positive definiteness** of the Hessian i.e.

 \begin{align}    
   \dfrac{\partial^2 H(x, u, p, t)}{\partial^2 u} > 0.
 \end{align}


 For **global minimality's sufficient conditions**, we basically perform an argmin over all \\(u\\) i.e.

 \begin{align}
  u^\star(t) = \arg \min_u H(x^\star(t), u, p^\star(t), t)
 \end{align}


If the final time, \\(t\_f\\) is fixed, then we have the **fixed endpoint problem** where there is no variation in \\(\delta t\_f\\) so that we have the boundary condition:

\begin{align}
  p^T(t\_f) = \dfrac{\partial V}{\partial x} + \dfrac{\partial \bar{V}^T}{\partial t\_f} \lambda\|\_{t_f}
\end{align}

And when no final state constraint exists, the boundary condition becomes

\begin{align}
  p(t\_f) = \dfrac{\partial V^T}{\partial x}\|\_{t_f}
\end{align}

#### **Time-Invariant Systems**

In the situation where the dynamics of \eqref{eq:system} together with the running cost \\(L(x, u, t) \\) have no explicit dependence on time, then the final time \\(t\_f\\) is fixed and these is no final state constraint so that the equations for the necessary conditions imply that

|        Variation             |       Name           |  Equation                     |
|:------------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
|    \\(\delta p \\)   |    State Equation | \\(\dot{x} = \dfrac{\partial H^T}{\partial p} \triangleq f(x, u)  \\)      |
 |    \\(\delta x \\)   |    Co-state Equation | \\(\dot{p} = -\dfrac{\partial H^T}{\partial x} \triangleq = - \dfrac{\partial f^T}{\partial x}  p + \dfrac{\partial L^T}{\partial x}\\)    |
|    \\(\delta u \\)   |    Input stationarity | \\(\dfrac{\partial H}{\partial u}  =0 \triangleq \dfrac{\partial L^T}{\partial u} + \dfrac{\partial f^T}{ \partial u} p \\)       |
 |    \\(\delta x\|\_{t\_f} \\)   |    Boundary cond.              | \\(\dfrac{\partial V}{\partial x} - p^T = -\dfrac{\partial \bar{V}^T}{\partial x} \lambda \\)     |
 |    \\(\delta t\_f \\)     |    Boundary cond.               | \\(H(t\_f) = 0 \\)  |

Moreover, it is trivial to show that the total derivative of the Hamiltonian is given by the expression:

\begin{align}
  \dfrac{dH^\star}{dt} = \dfrac{\partial H^\star}{\partial x}(x, p)\dot{x} + \dfrac{\partial H^\star}{\partial p}(x, p)\dot{p} = 0
\end{align}

### **Example Optimal Control using the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation**

> Here, we'll show by way of two examples how to solve the HJB pde+functional equation for a simple second-order system.

For consider the system of equations

\begin{align}
\dot{x}\_1 = x\_1 + 0.8x\_2
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\dot{x}\_2 = -x\_1 -x\_2 + x\_1^2 x\_2 + u \nonumber
\end{align}

where \\(x(0) = [3, 5]^T \\) and the performance index given by

\begin{align}
  J = \int \limits\_0^5 (x\_1^2 + u^2) dt + x\_1^4(5) + x\_2^4(5).
\end{align}

We see that \\(L(x, u, t) = x\_1^2 + u^2 \text{ and } V(x(T) =  x\_1^4(5) + x\_2^4(5) \\).

If we write \\(x(5) = [x\_1^2, x\_2^2]\\), then it follows that \\(V(x(T) = x^T(5) \, x(5)\\).

In addition, we can write the following:

**Optimal cost**: \\(J^\star(x, t) = \min\_{u[0, 5]} J(x, u, t)\\)

**Hamiltonian**:  \\(H(x, u, t) = L(x, u, t) + \left(\dfrac{\partial J^\star(x,t)}{\partial x}\right)\dot{x} := x\_1^2 +u^2 + \dfrac{\partial J^\star}{\partial x\_1}\dot{x}\_1 + \dfrac{\partial J^\star}{\partial x\_2}\dot{x}\_2. \\)

\\(\nabla H\_u\\) must vanish at the minimum point so that we have

\\(\nabla H\_u = 2u + \dfrac{\partial J^\star}{\partial x\_2} = 0\\) or \\(u^\star = -\dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{\partial J^\star}{\partial x\_2}\\).

Now, putting \\(u = u^\star\\) back in the Hamiltonian, we obtain the HJB equation

\\(\dfrac{\partial J^\star}{\partial t} = -H^\star(x, \nabla\_x J^\star(x,t), u, t)\\)

i.e.

\begin{align}
  H^\star(x, \nabla\_x J^\star, t) = x\_1^2 + \dfrac{1}{4} \dfrac{\partial J^\star}{\partial x\_2} + \dfrac{\partial J^\star}{\partial x\_1} \left(x\_1 + 0.8 x\_2^2\right) + \dfrac{\partial J^\star}{\partial x\_2} \left(-x\_1 - x\_2 +x\_1^2x\_2 - \dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{\partial J^\star}{\partial x\_2}\right)
\end{align}

so that

\begin{align}
  \dfrac{\partial J^\star}{\partial t} = -x\_1^2 - \dfrac{\partial J^\star}{\partial x\_1} \left(x\_1 + 0.8 x\_2^2\right) - \dfrac{\partial J^\star}{\partial x\_2} \left(\dfrac{1}{4}  -x\_1 - x\_2 +x\_1^2x\_2 - \dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{\partial J^\star}{\partial x\_2}\right)
\end{align}

with boundary condition

\begin{align}
  V(x(T)) = x\_1^4(5) + x\_2^4(5)
\end{align}

**Example 2**

Consider the damped pendulum system of equations

\begin{align}
\dot{x}\_1 = x\_2
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\dot{x}\_2 = 0.2x\_1 + sin(x\_1) + u \nonumber
\end{align}

with \\(x(0) = [0, 3]^T \\) and the performance index given by

\begin{align}
  J = \int \limits\_0^5 (x\_1^2 + x\_1x\_2 + x\_2^2 + u^2) dt + x\_1(5)x\_2(5)+ x\_1^3(5)x\_2^3(5).
\end{align}

We see that \\(L(x, u, t) = x\_1^2 + x\_1x\_2 + x\_2^2 + u^2 \text{ and } V(x(T) =  x\_1(5)x\_2(5)+ x\_1^3(5)x\_2^3(5)\\).

As before, we write

\begin{align}
  H = x\_1^2 + x\_1x\_2 + x\_2^2 + u^2 + \dfrac{\partial J^\star}{\partial x\_1} \dot{x}\_1+ \dfrac{\partial J^\star}{\partial x\_2} \dot{x}\_2
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  \triangleq x\_1^2 + x\_1x\_2 + x\_2^2 + u^2 + \dfrac{\partial J^\star}{\partial x\_1} x\_2+ \dfrac{\partial J^\star}{\partial x\_2} \left(0.2x\_2 + sin(x\_1) + u\right)
\end{align}

the stationary condition of optimality shows that \\(u^\star = \dfrac{-1}{2}\dfrac{\partial J^\star}{\partial x\_2}\\), so that we can rewrite the Hamiltonian as

\begin{align}
  H =  x\_1^2 + x\_1x\_2 + x\_2^2 + \dfrac{1}{4}\left(\dfrac{\partial J^\star}{\partial x\_2}\right)^2 +  \dfrac{\partial J^\star}{\partial x\_2} \left(0.2x\_2 + sin(x\_1) -\dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{\partial J^\star}{\partial x\_2} \right)
\end{align}

with boundary condition

\begin{align}
   J^\star(x(T)) = x\_1(5) x\_2(5) + x\_1^2(5) x\_2(5)^3
\end{align}

### **Conclusions**

Notice that the optimal policy \\(u^\star(t)\\) is basically an open-loop control strategy. Why so? \\(u^\star\\) was derived as a function of time \\(t\\). As a result, the strategy may not be robust to uncertainties and may be very sensitive. For practical applications, we generally want to have a feedback control policy that is state dependent in order to guarantee robustness to parametric variations and achieve robust stability and performance. Such a \\(u = u^\star(x)\\) would be helpful in analyzing the stability of states and convergence of system dynamics to equilibrium for all future times. Will post such methods in the future.
