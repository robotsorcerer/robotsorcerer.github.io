<!-- Strava summary -->
<h4><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>Strava Activities Summary</h4>

<p>Regular mortal on two wheels here. As often as I can get away from the lab, I like to pedal the metals of my bike, often logging approximately 120 miles a week -- during cycling season. I ride rain or shine, hell or highwater -- in the parching heats of sultry Texas, or the blustering cold winds of the  Midwest and the Eastern Seaboard. If you are in my area and would love to tag along on a ride, do not hesitate to shoot me an email.

Texas, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey Rider. Below is a screenshot of my recent activities summary. </p>
