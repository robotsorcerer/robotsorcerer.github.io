"_...Deduction [and] Induction ... render the indefinite definite; Deduction explicates; Induction evaluates: that is all. Over the chasm that yawns between the ultimate goal of science and such ideas of Man's environment as ... he managed to communicate to some fellow, we are building a cantilever bridge of induction, held together by scrientific struts and ties. Yet every plank of its advance is first laid by Retroduction alone, that is to say, by the spontaneous conjectures of instinctive reason ..._" ~ C.S. Peirce, Scientific Metaphysics (1908), S475


"_We think only through the medium of words -- languages are true analytical methods -- algebra, which is adapted to its purpose in every species of expression, in the most simple, most exact, and best manner possible, is at the same time a language and an analytical method. The art of reasoning is nothing more than a language well-arranged._" ~ Antoine Lavoisier

"_But, after all, the sciences have made progress, because philosophers have applied themselves with more attention to observe, and have communicated to their language that precision and accuracy which they have employed in their observations: In correcting their language they reason better._" ~ Abbé de Condillac

"_Knowing that no mathematical model can yield a complete description of reality, we must resign ourselves to the task of using a succession of models of greater and greater complexity in our efforts to understand. If we observe similar structural features possessed by the solutions of a sequence of models, then we may feel that we have an approximation to what is called a "law of nature."_" ~ R.E. Bellman


"_Robotics is not a single idea. It is a substantial body of scientific and engineering results, accumulated over centuries. It draws primarily from mathematics, physics, mechanical engineering, and computer science, but also from philosophy, psychology, biology and other fields. Robotics is the gathering place of these ideas. Robotics provides motivation. Robotics tests ideas and steers continuing research. Finally, robotics is the proof. Observing a robot’s behavior is the nearly compelling proof that machines can be aware of their surroundings, can develop meaningful goals, and can act effectively to accomplish those goals._" ~ Matthew Mason

"_From him and his example, I have also learned not to take glory in the difficulty of a proof: difficulty means we have not understood. The ideal is to be able to paint a landscape in which the proof is obvious. I admire how often he succeeded in reaching this ideal._" ~ Pierre Deligne, AMS Notices, Vol 63, #3, speaking of Alexandre Grothendieck

"_The basic idea is that machine tools obey cause and effect relationships that are within our ability to understand and control and that there is nothing random or probabilistic about their behavior. Everything happens for a reason and the list of reasons is small enough to manage._" ~ Jim Bryan

"_By this we mean that machine tool errors obey cause-and-effect relationships, and do not vary randomly for no reason. Further, the causes are not esoteric and uncontrollable, but can be explained in terms of familiar engineering principles._" ~ Bob Donaldson

"_Young men should prove theorems. Old men should write books._" ~ G.H. Hardy

"_It follows that the Scientist, like the Pilgrim, must wend a straight and narrow path between the Pitfalls of Oversimplification and the Morass of Overcomplication._" ~ R.E. Bellman, on including too many features of reality in a mathematical model or constructing a model in too simple a fashion.

"_In science as in the lottery, luck favors those who wager the
most – that is, by another analogy, those who are tilling
constantly the ground in their garden._" ~ Ramón y Cajal, Letters to a Young Investigator

"_The impossibility of separating the nomenclature of a science from the science itself, is owing to this, that every branch of physical science must consist of three things; the series of facts which are the objects of the science, the ideas which represent these facts, and the words by which these ideas are expressed. Like three impressions of the same seal, the word ought to produce the idea, and the idea to be a picture of the fact. And, as ideas are preserved and communicated by means of words, it necessarily follows that we cannot improve the language of any science without at the same time improving the science itself; neither can we, on the other hand, improve a science, without improving the language or nomenclature which belongs to it. However certain the facts of any science may be, and, however just the ideas we may have formed of these facts, we can only communicate false impressions to others, while we want words by which these may be properly expressed._" ~ Antoine Lavoisier

"_It is one of the first duties of a professor, for example, in any subject, to exaggerate a litle both the importance of his subject and his own importance in it_” ~ G. H. Hardy, 1940

"_Curiosity demands that we ask questions, that we try to put things together and try to understand this multitude of aspects as perhaps resulting from the action of a relatively small number of elemental things and forces acting in an infinite variety of combinations._" ~ Feynman, Lectures on Physics, Caltech

"_Classical mathematics concentrated on linear equations for a sound pragmatic reason: it could not solve anything else._" ~ Ian Stewart

_"Instead of applying observation to the things we wished to know, we have chosen rather to imagine them. Advancing from one ill founded supposition to another, we have at last bewildered ourselves amidst a multitude of errors. These errors becoming prejudices, are, of course, adopted as principles, and we thus bewilder ourselves more and more. The method, too, by which we conduct our reasonings is as absurd; we abuse words which we do not understand, and call this the art of reasoning. When matters have been brought this length, when errors have been thus accumulated, there is but one remedy by which order can be restored to the faculty of thinking; this is, to forget all that we have learned, to trace back our ideas to their source, to follow the train in which they rise, and, as my Lord Bacon says, to frame the human understanding anew._" ~ Abbé de Condillac

_"Simulations are like Michelin star restaurants but should be like McDonald's: ubiquitous and standardised_" ~ Craig Mcllhenny

"_...there is every reason to believe that when the human intellect ignores reality and concentrates within, it can no longer explain the simplest inner workings of life's machinery or of the world around us._" ~ Ramón y Cajal, Letters to a Young Investigator

"_Academia has largely become a small-idea factory. Rewarded for publishing more frequently, we search for "minimum publishable units." Not surprisingly, many papers turn out to be early "progress reports", quickly superseded. At the same time, there is a hugely increased pressure to secure outside funding, converting most of our best scientists into government contractors_" ~ PNA Report

"_It is a maxim universally admitted in geometry, and indeed in every branch of knowledge, that, in the progress of investigation, we should proceed from known facts to what is unknown. In early infancy, our ideas spring from our wants; the sensation of want excites the idea of the object by which it is to be gratified. In this manner, from a series of sensations, observations, and analyses, a successive train of ideas arises, so linked together, that an attentive observer may trace back to a certain point the order and connection of the whole sum of human knowledge._" ~ Carmen Giunta

"_Jira's actually pretty great if you set it up correctly. The ninth circle of hell is trying to manage complex, interconnected projects across multiple teams with multiple milestones in GitHub issues and project boards. There's a place for both._" ~ Brandon Black

"_The intellect is presented with phenomena marching in review before the sensory organs. It can be truly useful and productive only when limiting itself to the modest tasks of observation, description, and comparison, and of classification that is based on analogies and differences. A knowledge of underlying causes and empirical laws will then come slowly through the use of inductive methods._" ~ Ramón y Cajal, Letters to a Young Investigator

"_That which is static and repetitive is boring. That which is dynamic

“_We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil._” ~ Knuth, Donald

"_Good professors love smart students who delight in learning, even those who are smarter. But few delight in the presence of a self-centered and mean-spirited ass, even if they happen to be the brightest on the planet._" -- Tim Poston

"_So here is some useful advice: if you've won a Nobel Prize, and want to win a second one, work with a collaborator_" ~ Richard Muller

"_Maybe this is why data mining has largely replaced traditional hypothesis-driven science. We are awash in small discoveries, most of which are essentially detections of “statistically significant” patterns in big data. Usually, there is no unifying model or theory that generates predictions, testable or not. That would take too much time and thought. Even the elite scientific journals seem too favorable to observations of patterns in new data, even if irreproducible, possibly explained by chance, or utterly lacking any supporting theory. Except in a few areas, such as string theory and climate studies, there are few incentives to search for unifying principles, let alone large-scale models_" ~ PNA report


"_Perhaps the key to self-fulfillment is to unconsciously live consciously; But then perception is often reality. So the skillful scientist must wend the straight and narrow path between the fleeting perceptions of his character as arrogant and communicating his work in the most delicate way to carry as much people as possible along._"

"_Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts._" ~ Feynman

"_What will the theories and technologies of 2065 look like? If we are not careful, if we do not sufficiently value explanatory science and individual creativity, they will look pretty much like they do today. But if we do, many wonders may lie ahead—not only the elusive unified field theory for physics but perhaps also a new type of “theory” for cognition and consciousness, or maybe theories matching the scope and elegance of natural selection for other great challenges of biology, including the mechanisms of regulation and dysregulation (e.g., cancer and aging) at the cellular level and the prediction of structure and function at the molecular level. There is no lack of frontiers._"  ~ PNA Report

"_We have a habit in writing articles published in scientific journals to make the work as finished as possible, to cover all the tracks, to not worry about the blind alleys or to describe how you had the wrong idea first, and so on. So there isn't any place to publish, in a dignified manner, what you actually did in order to get to do the work._"

_"My father was a Stalinist and sent me to a private Christian school where we had to pray every morning. From a very young age I was convinced that many of the things that the teachers and other kids believed were just obvious nonsense. That's great training for a scientist and it transferred very well to artificial intelligence. But it was a nasty shock when I found out what Stalin actually did.﻿_"

  “_There are several ways in which a mathematician can
proceed to extend his research efforts, particularly one who
is deeply interested in problems arising from the physical
world. He can, on one hand, examine the equations he has
been working with and modify them in a variety of ways.
Or he can ask questions that have not been asked before
concerning the nature of the solution of the original equations.
This is basically a very difficult way to carry out
research. It is very easy to change the form of an equation
in a large number of ways. The great majority of the
new equations are not meaningful, and, in consequence,
lead to both difficult and unimportant problems. Similarly,
there are many questions that are difficult to answer, but
hardly worth asking. The well-trained mathematician does
not measure the value of a problem solely by its intractability.
The challenge is there, but even very small boys do not
accept all dares._”

"_We ought, in every instance, to submit our reasoning to the test of experiment, and never to search for truth but by the natural road of experiment and observation. Thus mathematicians obtain the solution of a problem by the mere arrangement of data, and by reducing their reasoning to such simple steps, to conclusions so very obvious, as never to lose sight of the evidence which guides them._" ~ Lavoisier

“_What I cannot create, I do not understand._”

“_The trick that one learns over time, a basic part of mathematical methodology,
is to sidestep the equation and focus instead on the structure of the underlying
physical process. One learns to submit oneself to a catechism: ‘When I set up
these equations originally, I made certain assumptions. How realistic were these
assumptions? What state variables, and what effects did I ignore?’’ …In the real
world, none of these assumptions are uniformly valid. Often people want to know
why mathematics and computers cannot be used to handle the meaningful problems
of society, as opposed, let us say, to the moon boondoggle and high energy–high
cost physics. The answer lies in the fact that we don’t know how to describe the
complex systems of society involving people, we don’t understand cause and effect,
which is to say the consequences of decisions, and we don’t even know how to make our
objectives reasonably precise. None of the requirements of classical science are
met._”

“_Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces. Clarity is better than cleverness. Design programs to be connected to other programs. Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines. Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must. Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do. Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier. Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity. Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be stupid and robust. In interface design, always do the least surprising thing. When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing. When you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible. Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time. Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can. Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it. Distrust all claims for ‘one true way’. Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think._”

"_In the study and practice of the sciences it is quite different; the false judgments we form neither affect our existence nor our welfare; and we are not forced by any physical necessity to correct them. Imagination, on the contrary, which is ever wandering beyond the bounds of truth, joined to self-love and that self-confidence we are so apt to indulge, prompt us to draw conclusions which are not immediately derived from facts; so that we become in some measure interested in deceiving ourselves. Hence it is by no means to be wondered, that, in the science of physics in general, men have often made suppositions, instead of forming conclusions. These suppositions, handed down from one age to another, acquire additional weight from the authorities by which they are supported, till at last they are received, even by men of genius, as fundamental truths._"  ~ Lavoisier       

“_Johnny von Neumann was a great mathematician and a great physicist.
  So someone (I don’t remember who) challenged him with this problem:
  Two trains are 100 meters apart, moving towards each other. Each train is
  moving at 10 meters per second.  A bee is flying back and forth between those
  two trains at 20 meters per second. Eventually the bee will be squished when
  the two trains crash against each other. When they do, what will be the total
  distance flown by the bee? According to legend, von Neumann thought for a moment,
   and then said “100 meters”. The questioner said, “Correct. But now I know,
   from the quickness of your response, that you are really a physicist, not
   a mathematician.  The mathematician would have calculated when each bee-train
   encounter takes place, calculated the position, taken the sum of those distances
   as an infinite series, and then summed the series.  But a physicist would have
   taken a short-cut; the physicists would have realized that the bee was flying
   for 5 seconds at 20 meters per second, so it would have traveled 100 meters
   total. Von Neumann’s purported response: “Oh, that’s a clever way to solve it!
  No, I summed the series._”
