"_It follows that the Scientist, like the Pilgrim, must wend a straight and narrow path between the Pitfalls of Oversimplification and the Morass of Overcomplication._" ~ R.E. Bellman, on including too many features of reality in a mathematical model or constructing a model in too simple a fashion.

"_In science as in the lottery, luck favors those who wager the
most – that is, by another analogy, those who are tilling
constantly the ground in their garden._" ~ Ramón y Cajal, Letters to a Young Investigator

"_Curiosity demands that we ask questions, that we try to put things together and try to understand this multitude of aspects as perhaps resulting from the action of a relatively small number of elemental things and forces acting in an infinite variety of combinations._" ~ Feynman, Lectures on Physics, Caltech

"_Knowing that no mathematical model can yield a complete description of reality, we must resign ourselves to the task of using a succession of models of greater and greater complexity in our efforts to understand. If we observe similar structural features possessed by the solutions of a sequence of models, then we may feel that we have an approximation to what is called a "law of nature."_" ~ R.E. Bellman

"_...there is every reason to believe that when the human intellect ignores reality and concentrates within, it can no longer explain the simplest inner workings of life's machinery or of the world around us._" ~ Ramón y Cajal, Letters to a Young Investigator

"_Academia has largely become a small-idea factory. Rewarded for publishing more frequently, we search for "minimum publishable units." Not surprisingly, many papers turn out to be early "progress reports", quickly superseded. At the same time, there is a hugely increased pressure to secure outside funding, converting most of our best scientists into government contractors_" ~ PNA Report

"_Jira's actually pretty great if you set it up correctly. The ninth circle of hell is trying to manage complex, interconnected projects across multiple teams with multiple milestones in GitHub issues and project boards. There's a place for both._" ~ Brandon Black

"_The intellect is presented with phenomena marching in review before the sensory organs. It can be truly useful and productive only when limiting itself to the modest tasks of observation, description, and comparison, and of classification that is based on analogies and differences. A knowledge of underlying causes and empirical laws will then come slowly through the use of inductive methods._" ~ Ramón y Cajal, Letters to a Young Investigator

"_That which is static and repetitive is boring. That which is dynamic
and random is confusing. In between lies art._" ~ John A. Locke

"_Science is a differential equation. Religion is a boundary condition._" ~ Alan Turing

"_An academic career, in which a person is forced to produce scientific writings in great amounts, creates a danger of intellectual superficiality_" ~ Albert Einstein

“_We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil._” ~ Knuth, Donald

"_Good professors love smart students who delight in learning, even those who are smarter. But few delight in the presence of a self-centered and mean-spirited ass, even if they happen to be the brightest on the planet._" -- Tim Poston

"_Look for the student who can learn the most, who can carry on a long term legacy of what the professor has to teach._"  ~ Richard Muller

"_So here is some useful advice: if you've won a Nobel Prize, and want to win a second one, work with a collaborator_" ~ Richard Muller

"_Maybe this is why data mining has largely replaced traditional hypothesis-driven science. We are awash in small discoveries, most of which are essentially detections of “statistically significant” patterns in big data. Usually, there is no unifying model or theory that generates predictions, testable or not. That would take too much time and thought. Even the elite scientific journals seem too favorable to observations of patterns in new data, even if irreproducible, possibly explained by chance, or utterly lacking any supporting theory. Except in a few areas, such as string theory and climate studies, there are few incentives to search for unifying principles, let alone large-scale models_" ~ PNA report


"_Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts._" ~ Feynman

"_What will the theories and technologies of 2065 look like? If we are not careful, if we do not sufficiently value explanatory science and individual creativity, they will look pretty much like they do today. But if we do, many wonders may lie ahead—not only the elusive unified field theory for physics but perhaps also a new type of “theory” for cognition and consciousness, or maybe theories matching the scope and elegance of natural selection for other great challenges of biology, including the mechanisms of regulation and dysregulation (e.g., cancer and aging) at the cellular level and the prediction of structure and function at the molecular level. There is no lack of frontiers._"  ~ PNA Report

_"We have a habit in writing articles published in scientific journals to make the work as finished as possible, to cover all the tracks, to not worry about the blind alleys or to describe how you had the wrong idea first, and so on. So there isn't any place to publish, in a dignified manner, what you actually did in order to get to do the work._"

_"My father was a Stalinist and sent me to a private Christian school where we had to pray every morning. From a very young age I was convinced that many of the things that the teachers and other kids believed were just obvious nonsense. That's great training for a scientist and it transferred very well to artificial intelligence. But it was a nasty shock when I found out what Stalin actually did.﻿_"

_"Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius -- and a lot of courage -- to move in the opposite direction._"   ~ Albert Einstein﻿

  “_There are several ways in which a mathematician can
proceed to extend his research efforts, particularly one who
is deeply interested in problems arising from the physical
world. He can, on one hand, examine the equations he has
been working with and modify them in a variety of ways.
Or he can ask questions that have not been asked before
concerning the nature of the solution of the original equations.
This is basically a very difficult way to carry out
research. It is very easy to change the form of an equation
in a large number of ways. The great majority of the
new equations are not meaningful, and, in consequence,
lead to both difficult and unimportant problems. Similarly,
there are many questions that are difficult to answer, but
hardly worth asking. The well-trained mathematician does
not measure the value of a problem solely by its intractability.
The challenge is there, but even very small boys do not
accept all dares._”
                – Richard E. Bellman

"_Finally, I’d like to challenge you to think of a PhD as more than just a sequence of papers. You’re not a paper writer. You’re a member of a research community and your goal is to push the field forward. Papers are one common way of doing that but I would encourage you to look beyond the established academic game. Think for yourself and from first principles. Do things others don’t do but should. Step off the treadmill that has been put before you._"

“_Math is not something boys are better at, it’s not a spectator sport,

   it’s not useless in the real world, it’s not beholden to the real world, it’s
    not learnable in one year or from one book or one website, it is not particularly
    interested in the golden ratio or the digits of pi or trivial calculation
    tricks that aren’t actually from the Vedas, it is not always explainable to
    a 6-year-old or in “layman’s terms”, it’s not beyond your grasp if you recognize
     that it will take time and dedication and active effort, it is not dry, it is
     not cold, it is not boring, it is not the opposite of “human” or “people-oriented”

“_C++ leads to really really bad design choices. You invariably start using
the “nice” library features of the language like STL and Boost and other
total and utter crap, that may “help” you program, but causes:_

  - _infinite amounts of pain when they don’t work (and anybody who tells me
that STL and especially Boost are stable and portable is just so full
of BS that it’s not even funny)_

  - _inefficient abstracted programming models where two years down the road
you notice that some abstraction wasn’t very efficient, but now all
your code depends on all the nice object models around it, and you
cannot fix it without rewriting your app._”

“_What I cannot create, I do not understand._”
                      – Richard Feynman

“_The trick that one learns over time, a basic part of mathematical methodology,
is to sidestep the equation and focus instead on the structure of the underlying
physical process. One learns to submit oneself to a catechism: ‘When I set up
these equations originally, I made certain assumptions. How realistic were these
assumptions? What state variables, and what effects did I ignore?’’ …In the real
world, none of these assumptions are uniformly valid. Often people want to know
why mathematics and computers cannot be used to handle the meaningful problems
of society, as opposed, let us say, to the moon boondoggle and high energy–high
cost physics. The answer lies in the fact that we don’t know how to describe the
complex systems of society involving people, we don’t understand cause and effect,
which is to say the consequences of decisions, and we don’t even know how to make our
objectives reasonably precise. None of the requirements of classical science are
met._”
                  – Richard Bellman

“_Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces. Clarity is better than cleverness. Design programs to be connected to other programs. Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines. Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must. Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do. Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier. Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity. Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be stupid and robust. In interface design, always do the least surprising thing. When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing. When you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible. Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time. Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can. Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it. Distrust all claims for ‘one true way’. Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think._”

“_He was very clear that entering a new field always meant discomfort. It was hard to raise money to do an experiment, and the existing experts would resent your entry. He told me that the only way to do it was with complete humility; you had to recognize that you didn’t know much. You have to become a student again. No shortcuts. Before you talk to any of the experts, study hard so that they won’t feel that you are wasting their time. If you can bring something new to an existing field, then you might make an important discovery._”

“_Johnny von Neumann was a great mathematician and a great physicist.
  So someone (I don’t remember who) challenged him with this problem:
  Two trains are 100 meters apart, moving towards each other. Each train is
  moving at 10 meters per second.  A bee is flying back and forth between those
  two trains at 20 meters per second. Eventually the bee will be squished when
  the two trains crash against each other. When they do, what will be the total
  distance flown by the bee? According to legend, von Neumann thought for a moment,
   and then said “100 meters”. The questioner said, “Correct. But now I know,
   from the quickness of your response, that you are really a physicist, not
   a mathematician.  The mathematician would have calculated when each bee-train
   encounter takes place, calculated the position, taken the sum of those distances
   as an infinite series, and then summed the series.  But a physicist would have
   taken a short-cut; the physicists would have realized that the bee was flying
   for 5 seconds at 20 meters per second, so it would have traveled 100 meters
   total. Von Neumann’s purported response: “Oh, that’s a clever way to solve it!
  No, I summed the series._”
