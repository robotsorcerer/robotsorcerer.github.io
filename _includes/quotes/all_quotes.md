"_From him and his example, I have also learned not to take glory in the difficulty of a proof: difficulty means we have not understood.

"_A role still  more important than generalization's in dealing with mathematical problems is played, I believe, by specialization. Perhaps in most cases where we seek in vain for the answer to a question the cause of failure lies in our having not yet or not completely solved problems simpler and easier than the one in hand. Everything depends then on finding these easier problems and effecting the solution of them by use of tools as perfect as possible and of concepts susceptible to generalization. This rule is one of the most important levers for overcoming mathematical difficulties ..._" ~ Hilbert, Mathematical Problems, Archiv fur Mathematik und Physik (3) 1, 44-63, 213-237 (1901).

"_Logic, after all, is a trick devised by the human mind to solve certain types of problems. But mathematics is more than logic, it is logic plus the creative process. How the logical devices that constitute the tools of mathematics are to be combined to yield the desired results is not necessarily logical, no more than the writing of a symphony is a logical exercise, or the painting of a picture an exercise in syllogisms._" ~ Richard Bellman, 1972.

"_The aim of science is to make difficult things understandable in a simpler way; the aim of poetry is to state simple things in an incomprehensible way. The two are incompatible._" ~ Paul Dirac, criticizing J. Robert Oppenheimer's love for poetry.

"_...Deduction [and] Induction ... render the indefinite definite; Deduction explicates; Induction evaluates: that is all. Over the chasm that yawns between the ultimate goal of science and such ideas of Man's environment as ... he managed to communicate to some fellow, we are building a cantilever bridge of induction, held together by scientific struts and ties.

"..._it is wrong to think that rigor is the enemy of simplicity. Numerous examples establish the opposite, that the rigorous method is also the simpler and easier to grasp.

<!-- "_I cannot understand why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins._" ~ Paul Dirac -->

"_It seems to be one of the fundamental features of nature that fundamental physical laws are described in terms of a mathematical theory of great beauty and power, needing quite a high standard of mathematics for one to understand it. You may wonder: Why is nature constructed along these lines? One can only answer that our present knowledge seems to show that nature is so constructed. We simply have to accept it. One could perhaps describe the situation by saying that God is a mathematician of a very high order, and He used very advanced mathematics in constructing the universe. Our feeble attempts at mathematics enable us to understand a bit of the universe, and as we proceed to develop higher and higher mathematics we can hope to understand the universe better._" ~ Paul Dirac, later in his life.

"_It could be that it is extremely difficult to start life. It might be that it is so difficult to start life that it has happened only once among all the planets... Let us consider, just as a conjecture, that the chance life starting when we have got suitable physical conditions is 10−100. I don't have any logical reason for proposing this figure, I just want you to consider it as a possibility. Under those conditions ... it is almost certain that life would not have started. And I feel that under those conditions it will be necessary to assume the existence of a god to start off life. I would like, therefore, to set up this connexion between the existence of a god and the physical laws: if physical laws are such that to start off life involves an excessively small chance, so that it will not be reasonable to suppose that life would have started just by blind chance, then there must be a god, and such a god would probably be showing his influence in the quantum jumps which are taking place later on. On the other hand, if life can start very easily and does not need any divine influence, then I will say that there is no god._" ~ Paul Dirac, 1971.

"_Robotics is not a single idea. It is a substantial body of scientific and engineering results, accumulated over centuries. It draws primarily from mathematics, physics, mechanical engineering, and computer science, but also from philosophy, psychology, biology and other fields. Robotics is the gathering place of these ideas. Robotics provides motivation. Robotics tests ideas and steers continuing research. Finally, robotics is the proof. Observing a robot’s behavior is the nearly compelling proof that machines can be aware of their surroundings, can develop meaningful goals, and can act effectively to accomplish those goals._" ~ Matthew Mason.

"_If we do not succeed in solving a mathematical problem, it is often because we have failed to recognize the more general standpoint from which the problem before us appears only as a single link in a chain of related problems. ... This way to find general methods is certainly the most practicable and the surest, for he who seeks for methods without having a definite problem in mind seeks in vain._" ~ Hilbert, Mathematical Problems, Archiv fur Mathematik und Physik (3) 1, 44-63, 213-237 (1901).


"_The basic idea is that machine tools obey cause and effect relationships that are within our ability to understand and control and that there is nothing random or probabilistic about their behavior. Everything happens for a reason and the list of reasons is small enough to manage._" ~ Jim Bryan.

"_In science as in the lottery, luck favors those who wager the
most – that is, by another analogy, those who are tilling

"_The impossibility of separating the nomenclature of a science from the science itself, is owing to this, that every branch of physical science must consist of three things; the series of facts which are the objects of the science, the ideas which represent these facts, and the words by which these ideas are expressed. Like three impressions of the same seal, the word ought to produce the idea, and the idea to be a picture of the fact. And, as ideas are preserved and communicated by means of words, it necessarily follows that we cannot improve the language of any science without at the same time improving the science itself; neither can we, on the other hand, improve a science, without improving the language or nomenclature which belongs to it. However certain the facts of any science may be, and, however just the ideas we may have formed of these facts, we can only communicate false impressions to others, while we want words by which these may be properly expressed._" ~ Antoine Lavoisier.

_"Instead of applying observation to the things we wished to know, we have chosen rather to imagine them. Advancing from one ill founded supposition to another, we have at last bewildered ourselves amidst a multitude of errors. These errors becoming prejudices, are, of course, adopted as principles, and we thus bewilder ourselves more and more. The method, too, by which we conduct our reasonings is as absurd; we abuse words which we do not understand, and call this the art of reasoning. When matters have been brought this length, when errors have been thus accumulated, there is but one remedy by which order can be restored to the faculty of thinking; this is, to forget all that we have learned, to trace back our ideas to their source, to follow the train in which they rise, and, as my Lord Bacon says, to frame the human understanding anew._" ~ Abbé de Condillac.

"_It is a maxim universally admitted in geometry, and indeed in every branch of knowledge, that, in the progress of investigation, we should proceed from known facts to what is unknown.

  “_There are several ways in which a mathematician can
proceed to extend his research efforts, particularly one who
is deeply interested in problems arising from the physical
world. He can, on one hand, examine the equations he has
been working with and modify them in a variety of ways.
Or he can ask questions that have not been asked before
concerning the nature of the solution of the original equations.
This is basically a very difficult way to carry out
research. It is very easy to change the form of an equation
in a large number of ways. The great majority of the
new equations are not meaningful, and, in consequence,
lead to both difficult and unimportant problems. Similarly,
there are many questions that are difficult to answer, but
hardly worth asking. The well-trained mathematician does
not measure the value of a problem solely by its intractability.
The challenge is there, but even very small boys do not
accept all dares._”

physical process. One learns to submit oneself to a catechism: ‘When I set up
these equations originally, I made certain assumptions. How realistic were these
assumptions? What state variables, and what effects did I ignore?’’ …In the real
world, none of these assumptions are uniformly valid. Often people want to know
why mathematics and computers cannot be used to handle the meaningful problems
of society, as opposed, let us say, to the moon boondoggle and high energy–high
cost physics. The answer lies in the fact that we don’t know how to describe the
complex systems of society involving people, we don’t understand cause and effect,
which is to say the consequences of decisions, and we don’t even know how to make our
objectives reasonably precise. None of the requirements of classical science are

“_Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces. Clarity is better than cleverness. Design programs to be connected to other programs. Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines. Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must. Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do. Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier. Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity. Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be stupid and robust. In interface design, always do the least surprising thing. When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing. When you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible. Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time. Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can. Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it. Distrust all claims for ‘one true way’.

"_In the study and practice of the sciences it is quite different; the false judgments we form neither affect our existence nor our welfare; and we are not forced by any physical necessity to correct them. Imagination, on the contrary, which is ever wandering beyond the bounds of truth, joined to self-love and that self-confidence we are so apt to indulge, prompt us to draw conclusions which are not immediately derived from facts; so that we become in some measure interested in deceiving ourselves. Hence it is by no means to be wondered, that, in the science of physics in general, men have often made suppositions, instead of forming conclusions. These suppositions, handed down from one age to another, acquire additional weight from the authorities by which they are supported, till at last they are received, even by men of genius, as fundamental truths._"  ~ Lavoisier.       

“_Johnny von Neumann was a great mathematician and a great physicist.

  Two trains are 100 meters apart, moving towards each other. Each train is
  moving at 10 meters per second.  A bee is flying back and forth between those
  two trains at 20 meters per second. Eventually the bee will be squished when
  the two trains crash against each other. When they do, what will be the total
  distance flown by the bee? According to legend, von Neumann thought for a moment,
   and then said “100 meters”. The questioner said, “Correct. But now I know,
   from the quickness of your response, that you are really a physicist, not
   a mathematician.  The mathematician would have calculated when each bee-train
   encounter takes place, calculated the position, taken the sum of those distances
   as an infinite series, and then summed the series.  But a physicist would have
   taken a short-cut; the physicists would have realized that the bee was flying
   for 5 seconds at 20 meters per second, so it would have traveled 100 meters
