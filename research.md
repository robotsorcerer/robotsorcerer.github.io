Hi there! I am a Researcher at Microsoft Research, New York. My work combines the elegance of machine learning and control theory with the practical impact of autonomous systems -- to the end of developing principled data-driven analysis and synthesis for real-world dynamical systems. Currently, I am focused on a range of topics spanning safety-critical learning systems, interactive machine learning, and devising optimally robust learning schemes for the control of nonlinear dynamical systems.

I am an active member of the AI, control, and robotics research communities â€” regularly engaging in peer reviewing activities for [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/), [International Federation of Automatic Control](https://www.ifac-control.org/) -- World Congress and Automatica alike, [Institute of Physics](https://www.iop.org/),  [ICML](https://icml.cc/), IEEE Access, [Conference on Decision and Control](https://2021.ieeecdc.org/), [IROS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Conference_on_Intelligent_Robots_and_Systems), [American Control Conference](https://acc2021.a2c2.org/),  ASME's [DSCC](https://event.asme.org/DSCC),  [ICRA](https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/fully-sponsored/icra), and [Neural Computing and Applications](https://www.springer.com/journal/521) among others.

Since January 2020, I have been a judge for NatGeo's [AI for Species Discovery Grant Applications](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/funding-opportunities/grants/). In the Fall of 2020 and Winter of 2021, I got to serve as Associate Editor for ICRA.
