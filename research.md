#### Research Abridgment


The rise in computational power together with the pervasiveness of big data has created new computing possbilities, technologicl innovations, and has spawned new business value chains including the evolving and emergent digital economy. Across these spates of development in modern society, the question of resilience and reliability, safety and robustness, as well as the assured predictability of behavior in the (autonomous) systems that we design and build has become timely and crucial. Emergent autonomous AI systems must make decisions with imperfect information, reason about the world through situated data (such as an automated airline ticket reservation system) and embodiments alike (such as a physical robot). In all these, we expect many automation systems to deliver without glitch as we automate away tasks that humans have traditionally done for over a century. My core research exists at the intersection of three intertwined fields (robotics, control theory, and machine learning). My research asks questions aimed at answering the challenges that modern technology presents to humanity viz., combining the elegance of strong mathematical rigor in imbuing resilience and robustness into the little margins that exist in emerging autonomous systems; reasoning future technologies into existence though clear conceptual analyses baked in strong scientific rigor, and leveraging bioinspiration to build emergent agent-centric systems as we continue to usher in a safe and desired haven for new technologies.

##### **In the words of my students:**

_"Thank you again Lekan. [Taking RBOT 250 with you] was quite a journey. But I feel more confident now with ROS because I figured all of the ROS system. I'll be looking forward to see you run the class again."_

_"Dr. Molu is very caring about his students. I love how he makes time for me to run over course notes, point out helpful reading materials, and work through problems together with me. I enjoy the examples and exercises he tasks us with."_

_"I want to thank Lekan for teaching this course, I definitely learned a lot. I am interested in auditing it when Lekan runs it again."_
