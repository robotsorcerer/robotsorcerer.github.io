Welcome to my web presence, where theory meets practice, and where scientific elegance meets creative practical impact.

#### **Minimal**

Lekan combines the scientific elegance of machine learning and control theory with the practical impact of autonomous systems. After his Masters’ degree in Control Systems at the University of Sheffield, he obtained his PhD in Electrical Engineering at The University of Texas at Dallas in 2019. He was a postdoc at the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) at The University of Pennsylvania from 2019 through 2021, where he worked on motion-planning for immobilizing cancer radiotherapy patients on a Stewart-Gough platform, as well as lead the design and control of a soft parallel robot mechanism for real-time patients’ head motion correction in stereo-tactic radiosurgery, and in emerging magnetic resonance-linear accelerator photon-based cancer therapy. Since joining MSR in 2021, his research thrusts revolve around safety-critical learning and motion-planning in constrained high-dimensional systems, with applications broadly towards systems verification and validation.

<!-- I am a roboticist (ML/Control specialist) with strong research thrusts in translational medical physics research. For the last 12 years, I have worked in several aspects of the automation research and development value chain in various capacities: this includes the consumer robots, supply chain, and process automation industries (Amazon Robotics, PFN Inc Japan, Coca-Cola).

After my doctorate in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Robotics Concentration), I held a brief postdoc stint at University of Chicago’s Duchossois Center for Advanced Medicine (DCAM) before moving to the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) at The University of Pennsylvania. At DCAM and PSOM, I proposed the design, and control of a Cephalopods-inspired parallel soft robot mechanism for real-time patient motion correction in intensity-modulated radiation therapy, stereo-tactic radiosurgery, and in emerging magnetic resonance-linear accelerator photon-based cancer therapy. -->


## **Continuum Mechanics Jovial Trivia**

Welcome to my web presence: the material, the referential, the spatial, and the relative!

**Material Description**

I am an interdisciplinary researcher who combines the scientific elegance of **machine learning** and **control theory** with the practical impact of **robotics** to create technological solutions that improve radiation delivery for cancer patients.  

**Spatial Description: Placements**

**Eulerian Placement**: I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Wiersma lab at [Penn Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu/) and I was previously with the group at [UChicago Medicine](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/). Here, I am foraging for knowledge and understanding. <i>Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas!</i>

**Lagrangean Placement**: During my [PhD]( https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/maia/about/meet-our-team.html), I was co-advised by [Steve Jiang](https://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/150563/steve-jiang.html) in the Medical Physics and Engineering program at [UT Southwestern](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu) and [Nick Gans](/about) in the Electrical Engineering program at [UT Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/).



**Backtracking through time**: Many years ago, I was part of [Sheffield ACSE](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/acse). There, I was mentored in robotics by [Tony Dodd](http://www.catch.org.uk/team-member/prof-tony-dodd/). Prior to that, I had my Bachelors in Physics with a minor in Electronics. My thesis was on the single [fractional parentage coefficients](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.527930) in the sd-shell nuclei, advised by [Ademola Amusa](https://prabook.com/web/ademola.amusa/473412).

**Current Configuration:** I work on problems spanning conceptualization of new hardware  and software tools for improving the **treatment planning** process in **cancer radiation therapy**. I am largely an independent researcher who enjoys self-direction at my own projects/goals. Yet, I value collaboration across domains and with people of diverse expertise. I read widely and study avidly: my interests span the sciences, technical disciplines (hello, chemistry, physics and engineering) to history and public affairs (really?). A big believer in open science and reproducible research, I try to make my publications and codes public to the extent that I can: see my [publications page](/pubs) and  [github repos](https://github.com/lakehanne). **I am not a robot**. My PGP key on most public key servers is 03E3 58FB 1D98 869E 8ABE 1EF0 E6A1 2F95 B720 BBB5.  If you are ~~Russian and you would like to collude~~ a researcher and you would like to collaborate, please <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email</a> me.


**Referential Description**: On the Origin and Wanderings of this Specie

I speak and write fluently in [Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language) and English -- languages I have used throughout my entire life. Having lived in Japan, I acquired a basic understanding of ~~Japaneasy~~ Japanese. I am working on a working-level proficiency (still another mile!). I love to meet people from other places and backgrounds -- it strengthens my understanding of the human culture. My accent has often been compared to the French one, though I have no idea what that is. I enjoy Afro-Jazz, Japanese Jazz, and alternative rock music genres. I do have an electric guitar, which I lazily play when I'm depressed. Someday, I do hope to be a street entertainer (_wouldn't that be fun?_).
<!-- I do have a base electric guitar I've played so hard that my forearm went through the drum. This led my acquaintance to suggest to me that I might benefit from going to a therapist, whom I visited. First session with the therapist, I was asked what my purpose was for being there. I told her I was angry at the world and its people.  -->
At various times in my little time on this planet, I have been a [_Shikaakwaan_](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/07/how-chicago-got-its-name/), a _[Lagosian](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Lagosian)_, a _[Sheffielder](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sheffielder) (home of my forever friends)_, a _Bostonian_, a _Londoner_, an _[Edokko](https://web-japan.org/tokyo/know/edokko/edo.html)_,  and a  _[Dallasite](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2012/01/are-we-dallasites-or-dallasonians-fort-worthers-or-fort-worthians-etymology-tells-us-who-we-are/) (Eh!)_.  

#### **Miscellaneous**

<!-- +   I like to think I take a lot of pain in my duties since I do derive pleasures in them. Each day, I gird my loins with strength and apply myself to my work: I lay my hand to the spindle and my hands hold to the distaff (like the proverbial virtuous woman :-) ).  To the end that when I am old and tired, I shall be able to reflect with comfort that I was not idle or useless when I was young. -->

+ I fancy conceptualization, finding issues and directions, definitions, expositions and critical insight. I like to investigate the physics behind machines, and to understand the interconnectedness of components, seeing design flaws,  and improvising upon them.

+ ~~I am a member of North Texas Drone Users Group. We fly our drones, micro-UAVs, and mini-planes around the DFW area every Saturday just to disturb the peace and quiet of boring citizens.~~ I am no longer active with this group.

+ I enjoy mentoring committed undergraduates, masters students, and occasionally high school students that are interested in computer vision, control, and robotics.

Outside of research, I am a cyclist, a runner, an hiker, and my friends tell me that I am an encourager. I did not start competitive cycling (mountain-biking) since about 2011. I graduated myself to road bikes in 2014. I've been part of various cycling clubs through the years, notably the [University of Sheffield Cycling Club](https://www.sport-sheffield.com/clubs/cycling), , [Plano Cycling Club](https://planobicycle.org/) and the [University of Chicago Velo Club](https://www.uchicagovelo.com/) among others.  When running, I mostly stick to 5 and 10k’s either with my friends at [Somerville road runners](https://www.srr.org/), [Frisco running club](https://friscorunningclub.com/) or alone. Whether I am running, cycling or back-packing, my happy place is time out in Mother Earth, marveling in creation's grand design.
