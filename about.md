Welcome to my web presence, where theory meets practice, and where scientific elegance meets creative practical impact.

#### **Minimal**

Lekan combines the scientific elegance of machine learning and control theory with the practical impact of autonomous systems. After his Masters’ degree in Control Systems at the University of Sheffield, he obtained his PhD in Electrical Engineering at The University of Texas at Dallas in 2019. He was a postdoc at the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) at The University of Pennsylvania from 2019 through 2021, where he worked on motion-planning for immobilizing cancer radiotherapy patients on a Stewart-Gough platform, as well as lead the design and control of a soft parallel robot mechanism for real-time patients’ head motion correction in stereo-tactic radiosurgery, and in emerging magnetic resonance-linear accelerator photon-based cancer therapy. Since joining MSR in 2021, his research thrusts revolve around safety-critical learning and motion-planning in constrained high-dimensional systems, with applications broadly towards systems verification and validation.

Outside of research, I am a cyclist, a runner, and an hiker. I did not start competitive cycling (mountain-biking) since about 2011. I graduated myself to road bikes in 2014. I've been part of various cycling clubs through the years, notably the [University of Sheffield Cycling Club](https://www.sport-sheffield.com/clubs/cycling), [Plano Cycling Club](https://planobicycle.org/) and the [University of Chicago Velo Club](https://www.uchicagovelo.com/) among others.  When running, I mostly stick to 5 and 10k’s either with my friends or alone. Whether I am running, cycling or back-packing, my happy place is time out in Mother Earth.
