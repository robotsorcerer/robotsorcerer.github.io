### Intro

Welcome to my web presence: the material, the referential, the spatial, and the relative<sup>Truesdell, '77</sup>! So as not to confuse my material and referential description, at least _locally_, I have some more info for you below. Please read along!

#### Tell me what you got

I am an interdisciplinary researcher who combines the scientific elegance of `machine learning` and `control theory` with the practical impact of `robotics` to create technological solutions for cancer  patients' healthcare. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Wiersma lab at the `University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine` and I was previously with the group at the `University of Chicago's School of Medicine.` During my [PhD]( https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/maia/about/meet-our-team.html), I was co-advised by [Steve Jiang](https://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/150563/steve-jiang.html) in the Medical Physics and Engineering program at [UT Southwestern](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu) and [Nick Gans](https://utdallas.edu/~ngans) in the Electrical Engineering program at [UT Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/). 

I have been working and still work on problems spanning `conceptualization` of new `hardware`  and `software` tools for improving the `treatment planning` process in `cancer radiation therapy`. I am largely an independent researcher who enjoys self-direction at my own projects/goals. Yet, I value collaboration across domains and with people of diverse expertise. I read widely and study avidly: my interests span the sciences, technical disciplines (hello, chemistry, physics and engineering) to history and public affairs (really?). A big believer in open science and reproducible research, I try to make my publications and codes public to the extent that I can: see my [publications page](/pubs) and  [github repos](https://github.com/lakehanne). **I am not a robot**. My PGP key on most public key servers is 03E3 58FB 1D98 869E 8ABE 1EF0 E6A1 2F95 B720 BBB5.  If you would like to collaborate, please email me.


#### On the Origin of this Specie


I speak and write fluently in [Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language) and English -- languages I have used throughout my entire life. Having lived in Japan, I acquired a basic understanding of ~~Japaneasy~~ Japanese. I am working on a working-level proficiency (still another mile!). I love to meet people from other places and backgrounds -- it strengthens my understanding of the human culture. My accent has often been compared to the French one, though I have no idea what that is. I enjoy Afro-Jazz, Japanese Jazz, and alternative rock music genres. I do have an electric guitar, which I lazily play when I'm depressed. Someday, I do hope to be a street entertainer (_wouldn't that be fun?_).
There are many places I call home including [Chicago](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/07/how-chicago-got-its-name/), [Lagos](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Lagosian),  [Sheffield](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sheffielder), and Boston. 
At various times in my little time on this planet, I have been a [_Shikaakwaan_](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/07/how-chicago-got-its-name/), a _[Lagosian](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Lagosian)_, a _[Sheffielder](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sheffielder) (home of my forever friends)_, a _Bostonian_, a _Londoner_, an _[Edokko](https://web-japan.org/tokyo/know/edokko/edo.html)_,  and a  _[Dallasite](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2012/01/are-we-dallasites-or-dallasonians-fort-worthers-or-fort-worthians-etymology-tells-us-who-we-are/) (Eh!)_.  


#### Miscellaneous

+   I fancy conceptualization, finding issues and directions, definitions, expositions and critical insight. I like to investigate the physics behind machines, and to understand the interconnectedness of components, seeing design flaws,  and improvising upon them.

<!-- + I regularly peer-review for the following academic conferences and journals:

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Institute of Physics: Measurement Science and Technology (Journal)

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Neural Computing and Applications (NCAA Journal)

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) World Congress

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - American Control Conference (ACC) -->

<!-- + I had my masters degree in Control Systems from Sheffield Uni in the UK.

+ I had my Bachelors in Physics. Specifically, my thesis was on the single fractional parentage coefiicients in the sd-shell nuclei, advised by [Prof. Ademola Amusa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ademola-amusa-b40812122/). -->

<!-- + In a previous life, I was a manager at Coca-Cola HBC. The thrill of discovery and the joy  of creative achievement led me to embrace the limited earning prospects of an academic life. -->

+ ~~I am a co-owner of the Linux, OpenStack, and Unix Networking video tutorials on [this](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-0PMn0rKV_ZOHF-qX6N3fQ/videos) youtube page.~~ Too busy eating cheap seminar foods on campus. [Strong Reject!](http://strongreject.com/)

+ ~~I am a member of North Texas Drone Users Group. We fly our drones, micro-UAVs, and mini-planes around the DFW area every Saturday just to disturb the peace and quiet of boring citizens.~~ I am no longer active with this group.


+ I enjoy mentoring committed undergraduates, masters students, and occasionally high school students that are interested in computer vision, control, and robotics.

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -   [Ajith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajithvenkateswaran) is a Senior Robotics Software Engineer at Samsung Research, America.

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -   [Adwait](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adwaitkulkarni93) is an Engineer at [Drov. Tech, MN](http://drovtech.com).

<!-- + I still consider Sheffield my adopted home. Biggest village in Yorkshire, where I've made some of my biggest mistakes; where I've met some of the best people I could ever hope to know. City of hills. Home of the Yorkshire pudding. Of thee I sing!
#### Name Etymology

People often ask me how to pronounce my name, and its meaning. Here we go:

+ Lekan is the short form of "Olalekan", which literally means "wealth increased by a factor of one" in [Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language), a (Benin-Congo) language of the [Yoruba people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_people) of West Africa.

+ Lekan is pronounced "Lay-con", or "Lay-kañ", where "añ" is akin to the intonation of "ION" in say, "captION".  

+ My last name is rather a little long-winding to roll on the tongue. But let me deconstruct its meaning first. From what I understand, my paternal ancestors
migrated from the Delta area of Nigeria (Warri, specifically) to Yorubaland many generations ago. They fully assimilated into the local Yoruba culture, and became part [Ifá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If%C3%A1) divinators, and part [Ogun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogun)  worshippers to boot (it is rather amusing that I chose the Engineering profession given that Ogun is generally worshipped by blacksmiths and technologists); "molu" is a compressed form of "mu olu", often abbreviated as "m'olu" or "molu" in contemporary Yoruba; it means "to take victory" or something of that facsimile. If you're catching my drift already, you'll see where this is going: Ogunmolu means "the god of iron prevailed". It's altogether pronounced as "O-goon-moh-loo". There you go.


+   When I am not busy, I am probably on [quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Lekan-4), the [ros answers forum](http://answers.ros.org) or the [pytorch forum](http://discuss.pytorch.org) answering and posting questions.

+   Among the places I call home include Lagos, Nigeria; Sheffield, United Kingdom; Boston, MA; and of course Tokyo, Japan.
