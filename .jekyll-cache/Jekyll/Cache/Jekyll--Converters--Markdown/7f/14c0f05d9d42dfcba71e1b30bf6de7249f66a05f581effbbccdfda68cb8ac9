I"õ<p>Hi there! I am a Researcher at Microsoft Research, New York. My work combines the scientific elegance of machine learning and control theory with the practical impact of autonomous systems â€“ to the end of developing principled data-driven analysis and synthesis for real-world dynamical systems. Currently, I am focused on a range of topics spanning safety-critical learning systems, interactive machine learning, and devising optimally robust learning schemes for the control of nonlinear dynamical systems.</p>
