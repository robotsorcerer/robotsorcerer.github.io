I"˛<p>Through the looking-glass, tired of working my brain out while familiarizing myself with a giant codebase I was reverse-engineering to prove a theory for an upcoming conference, I started asking myself why I was doing what I was doing? Just to get a paper out? Or to make a great contribution to science and my field? I googled something along the lines of ‚Äú<em>How to write a best IEEE RAS conference paper</em>‚Äù. What I found was very interesting as I came across this <a href="/assets/ieee-best-paper/best_paper.pdf">IEEE Student Activities Committee Paper</a>. It offers
great insight into what constitutes writing a paper that merits IEEE Robotics and Automation Society best conference awards.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I did.</p>
