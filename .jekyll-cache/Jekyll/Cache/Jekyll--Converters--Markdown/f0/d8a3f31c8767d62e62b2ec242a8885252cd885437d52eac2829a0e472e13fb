    <blockquote>
      <p>Many readers will skim over formulas on their first reading of your exposition. Therefore, your sentences should flow smoothly when all but the simplest formulas are replaced by ‚Äúblah‚Äù or some other grunting noise.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Sometimes it‚Äôs useful to think that everyone else is an idiot. This lets you do things that no one else is doing. It‚Äôs best not to be too vocal about that. You can say something like ‚ÄúOh, I just thought I‚Äôd try out this direction‚Äù</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I think the most important thing in research is a story ‚Äì not a theorem or an algorithm ‚Äì but the story that makes the theorem or algorithm interesting and exciting. ¬†¬†It‚Äôs important to have an ‚Äúear‚Äù for a good story‚Ä¶ when do the stories make sense, when are they bogus? ~ Tomas Lozano-Perez.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The best students are possessed by a problem. They‚Äôre independent. They teach their advisors. They don‚Äôt do what they‚Äôre told‚Ä¶they do something more interesting. ~ Leslie Kaelbling</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Don‚Äôt tell your advisor you‚Äôre doing what they advised against until you‚Äôve solved the problem. ~ Manolis Kellis</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Which brings us to the moral of the story: More important than your thesis topic is who your advisor is. ~ Charles Leiserson</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Eat, sleep, and breathe a problem until you crack it. Become the world‚Äôs foremost expert on your thesis topic. Surpass your advisor.  ~ Daniel Jackson</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Start by stating which problem you are addressing, keeping the audience in mind.  They must care about it, which means that sometimes you must tell them why they should care about the problem.  Then state briefly what the other solutions are to the problem, and why they aren‚Äôt satisfactory.  If they were satisfactory, you wouldn‚Äôt need to do the work.  Then explain your own solution, compare it with other solutions, and say why it‚Äôs bettter.  At the end, talk about related work where similar techniques and experiments have been used, but applied to a different problem.  Since I developed this formula, it seems that all the papers I‚Äôve written have been accepted.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Picking a problem
    <ul>
      <li>Formulate a larger goal</li>
      <li>Personally meaningful</li>
      <li>Fits into the scheme of collective progress</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Analyze bottlenecks</li>
  <li>
    <p>Understand the state of the art</p>
  </li>
  <li>Making a contribution:
    <ul>
      <li>Read the papers</li>
      <li>Look for unwarranted assumptions</li>
      <li>What are the limitations? When will this break? How could this be done better?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reimplement a state-of-the-art technique
    <ul>
      <li>Reproduce the results</li>
      <li>Then bombard it with controlled experiments</li>
      <li>Look for surprises, cracks that lead to deeper realizations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Be on the lookout for interesting contributions</li>
  <li>Many important findings are not what the researchers set out to find
    <ul>
      <li>‚ÄúScheele happened upon chlorine while trying to isolate manganese; Claude Bernard planned experiments to characterize the destructive agent in sugar but instead discovered the glycogenic function of the liver; and so on‚Äù

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Research over time
    <ul>

  <li>For pete‚Äôs sake, get a good work ethic
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>I do not believe a person can ever leave their business. They ought to think of it by day and dream of it by night. [‚Ä¶] if they intend to go forward and do anything, the whistle is only a signal to start thinking over the day‚Äôs work in order to discover how it might be done better. [‚Ä¶] The person who has the largest capacity for work and thought is the person who is bound to succeed.

        <p>In science as in the lottery, luck favors those who wager the most ‚Äì that is, by another analogy, those who are tilling constantly the ground in their garden.

      <li>
        <p>Successful people exhibit more activity, more energy, than most people do. They look more places, they work harder, they think longer than less successful people. Knowledge and ability are much like compound interest ‚Äì the more you do the more you can do, and the more opportunities are open for you.

<p>Always punctuate your equations. Math is prose. Number all equations in your text. It helps your readers.</p>
