‚Äú<em>Logic, after all, is a trick devised by the human mind to solve certain types of problems. But mathematics is more than logic, it is logic plus the creative process. How the logical devices that constitute the tools of mathematics are to be combined to yield the desired results is not necessarily logical, no more than the writing of a symphony is a logical exercise, or the painting of a picture an exercise in syllogisms.</em>‚Äù ~ Richard Bellman, 1972</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>The aim of science is to make difficult things understandable in a simpler way; the aim of poetry is to state simple things in an incomprehensible way. The two are incompatible.</em>‚Äù ~ Paul Dirac, criticizing J. Robert Oppenheimer‚Äôs love for poetry.</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>‚Ä¶Deduction [and] Induction ‚Ä¶ render the indefinite definite; Deduction explicates; Induction evaluates: that is all. Over the chasm that yawns between the ultimate goal of science and such ideas of Man‚Äôs environment as ‚Ä¶ he managed to communicate to some fellow, we are building a cantilever bridge of induction, held together by scientific struts and ties. Yet every plank of its advance is first laid by Retroduction alone, that is to say, by the spontaneous conjectures of instinctive reason ‚Ä¶</em>‚Äù ~ C.S. Peirce, Scientific Metaphysics (1908), S475</p>

<p>‚Äú_ ‚Ä¶Don‚Äôt apply any model until you understand the simplifying assumptions on which it is based, and you can test their validity. Catch phrase: Use only as directed. Don‚Äôt believe that the model is the reality. Catch phrase: You will never strike oil by drilling through the map._‚Äù ~ Saul Golomb, ‚ÄúMathematical Models ‚Äì Uses and Limitations.‚Äù 1970</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>‚ÄòWhy do you dance?‚Äô Dirac asked his companion, Heisenberg. ‚ÄòWhen there are nice girls, it is a pleasure,‚Äô Heisenberg replied. Dirac pondered this notion, then blurted out: ‚ÄòBut, Heisenberg, how do you know beforehand that the girls are nice?‚Äô</em>‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>We think only through the medium of words ‚Äì languages are true analytical methods ‚Äì algebra, which is adapted to its purpose in every species of expression, in the most simple, most exact, and best manner possible, is at the same time a language and an analytical method. The art of reasoning is nothing more than a language well-arranged.</em>‚Äù ~ Antoine Lavoisier</p>

<p>‚Äú‚Ä¶<em>it is wrong to think that rigor is the enemy of simplicity. Numerous examples establish the opposite, that the rigorous method is also the simpler and easier to grasp. The pursuit of rigor compels us to discover simpler arguments; also, often it clears the path to methods susceptible of more development than were the old, less rigorous ones.</em> ‚Ä¶ ‚Äú ~ Hilbert, Mathematical Problems, Archiv fur Mathematik und Physik (3) 1, 44-63, 213-237 (1901)</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>I have an equation. Do you have one too?</em>‚Äù ~ Paul Dirac, to a young Feynman</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>But, after all, the sciences have made progress, because philosophers have applied themselves with more attention to observe, and have communicated to their language that precision and accuracy which they have employed in their observations: In correcting their language they reason better.</em>‚Äù ~ Abb√© de Condillac</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>Knowing that no mathematical model can yield a complete description of reality, we must resign ourselves to the task of using a succession of models of greater and greater complexity in our efforts to understand. If we observe similar structural features possessed by the solutions of a sequence of models, then we may feel that we have an approximation to what is called a ‚Äúlaw of nature.‚Äù</em>‚Äù ~ R.E. Bellman</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>I cannot understand why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest‚Äîand scientists have to be‚Äîwe must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can‚Äôt for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards‚Äîin heaven if not on earth‚Äîall those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.</em>‚Äù ~ Paul Dirac</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>It seems to be one of the fundamental features of nature that fundamental physical laws are described in terms of a mathematical theory of great beauty and power, needing quite a high standard of mathematics for one to understand it. You may wonder: Why is nature constructed along these lines? One can only answer that our present knowledge seems to show that nature is so constructed. We simply have to accept it. One could perhaps describe the situation by saying that God is a mathematician of a very high order, and He used very advanced mathematics in constructing the universe. Our feeble attempts at mathematics enable us to understand a bit of the universe, and as we proceed to develop higher and higher mathematics we can hope to understand the universe better.</em>‚Äù ~ Paul Dirac, later in his life.</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>It could be that it is extremely difficult to start life. It might be that it is so difficult to start life that it has happened only once among all the planets‚Ä¶ Let us consider, just as a conjecture, that the chance life starting when we have got suitable physical conditions is 10‚àí100. I don‚Äôt have any logical reason for proposing this figure, I just want you to consider it as a possibility. Under those conditions ‚Ä¶ it is almost certain that life would not have started. And I feel that under those conditions it will be necessary to assume the existence of a god to start off life. I would like, therefore, to set up this connexion between the existence of a god and the physical laws: if physical laws are such that to start off life involves an excessively small chance, so that it will not be reasonable to suppose that life would have started just by blind chance, then there must be a god, and such a god would probably be showing his influence in the quantum jumps which are taking place later on. On the other hand, if life can start very easily and does not need any divine influence, then I will say that there is no god.</em>‚Äù ~ Paul Dirac, 1971</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>Robotics is not a single idea. It is a substantial body of scientific and engineering results, accumulated over centuries. It draws primarily from mathematics, physics, mechanical engineering, and computer science, but also from philosophy, psychology, biology and other fields. Robotics is the gathering place of these ideas. Robotics provides motivation. Robotics tests ideas and steers continuing research. Finally, robotics is the proof. Observing a robot‚Äôs behavior is the nearly compelling proof that machines can be aware of their surroundings, can develop meaningful goals, and can act effectively to accomplish those goals.</em>‚Äù ~ Matthew Mason</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>From him and his example, I have also learned not to take glory in the difficulty of a proof: difficulty means we have not understood. The ideal is to be able to paint a landscape in which the proof is obvious. I admire how often he succeeded in reaching this ideal.</em>‚Äù ~ Pierre Deligne, AMS Notices, Vol 63, #3, speaking of Alexandre Grothendieck</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>If we do not succeed in solving a mathematical problem, it is often because we have failed to recognize the more general standpoint from which the problem before us appears only as a single link in a chain of related problems. ‚Ä¶ This way to find general methods is certainly the most practicable and the surest, for he who seeks for methods without having a definite problem in mind seeks in vain.</em>‚Äù ~ Hilbert, Mathematical Problems, Archiv fur Mathematik und Physik (3) 1, 44-63, 213-237 (1901)</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>The basic idea is that machine tools obey cause and effect relationships that are within our ability to understand and control and that there is nothing random or probabilistic about their behavior. Everything happens for a reason and the list of reasons is small enough to manage.</em>‚Äù ~ Jim Bryan</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>By this we mean that machine tool errors obey cause-and-effect relationships, and do not vary randomly for no reason. Further, the causes are not esoteric and uncontrollable, but can be explained in terms of familiar engineering principles.</em>‚Äù ~ Bob Donaldson</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>Young men should prove theorems. Old men should write books.</em>‚Äù ~ G.H. Hardy</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>It follows that the Scientist, like the Pilgrim, must wend a straight and narrow path between the Pitfalls of Oversimplification and the Morass of Overcomplication.</em>‚Äù ~ R.E. Bellman, on including too many features of reality in a mathematical model or constructing a model in too simple a fashion.</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>In science as in the lottery, luck favors those who wager the
most ‚Äì that is, by another analogy, those who are tilling
constantly the ground in their garden.</em>‚Äù ~ Ram√≥n y Cajal, Letters to a Young Investigator</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>The impossibility of separating the nomenclature of a science from the science itself, is owing to this, that every branch of physical science must consist of three things; the series of facts which are the objects of the science, the ideas which represent these facts, and the words by which these ideas are expressed. Like three impressions of the same seal, the word ought to produce the idea, and the idea to be a picture of the fact. And, as ideas are preserved and communicated by means of words, it necessarily follows that we cannot improve the language of any science without at the same time improving the science itself; neither can we, on the other hand, improve a science, without improving the language or nomenclature which belongs to it. However certain the facts of any science may be, and, however just the ideas we may have formed of these facts, we can only communicate false impressions to others, while we want words by which these may be properly expressed.</em>‚Äù ~ Antoine Lavoisier</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>It is one of the first duties of a professor, for example, in any subject, to exaggerate a litle both the importance of his subject and his own importance in it</em>‚Äù ~ G. H. Hardy, 1940</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>Curiosity demands that we ask questions, that we try to put things together and try to understand this multitude of aspects as perhaps resulting from the action of a relatively small number of elemental things and forces acting in an infinite variety of combinations.</em>‚Äù ~ Feynman, Lectures on Physics, Caltech</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
From the ashes, a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king.</em>‚Äù ~ J.R.R. Tolkien</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>Classical mathematics concentrated on linear equations for a sound pragmatic reason: it could not solve anything else.</em>‚Äù ~ Ian Stewart</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúInstead of applying observation to the things we wished to know, we have chosen rather to imagine them. Advancing from one ill founded supposition to another, we have at last bewildered ourselves amidst a multitude of errors. These errors becoming prejudices, are, of course, adopted as principles, and we thus bewilder ourselves more and more. The method, too, by which we conduct our reasonings is as absurd; we abuse words which we do not understand, and call this the art of reasoning. When matters have been brought this length, when errors have been thus accumulated, there is but one remedy by which order can be restored to the faculty of thinking; this is, to forget all that we have learned, to trace back our ideas to their source, to follow the train in which they rise, and, as my Lord Bacon says, to frame the human understanding anew.</em>‚Äù ~ Abb√© de Condillac</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúSimulations are like Michelin star restaurants but should be like McDonald‚Äôs: ubiquitous and standardised</em>‚Äù ~ Craig Mcllhenny</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>‚Ä¶there is every reason to believe that when the human intellect ignores reality and concentrates within, it can no longer explain the simplest inner workings of life‚Äôs machinery or of the world around us.</em>‚Äù ~ Ram√≥n y Cajal, Letters to a Young Investigator</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>Academia has largely become a small-idea factory. Rewarded for publishing more frequently, we search for ‚Äúminimum publishable units.‚Äù Not surprisingly, many papers turn out to be early ‚Äúprogress reports‚Äù, quickly superseded. At the same time, there is a hugely increased pressure to secure outside funding, converting most of our best scientists into government contractors</em>‚Äù ~ PNA Report</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>It is a maxim universally admitted in geometry, and indeed in every branch of knowledge, that, in the progress of investigation, we should proceed from known facts to what is unknown. In early infancy, our ideas spring from our wants; the sensation of want excites the idea of the object by which it is to be gratified. In this manner, from a series of sensations, observations, and analyses, a successive train of ideas arises, so linked together, that an attentive observer may trace back to a certain point the order and connection of the whole sum of human knowledge.</em>‚Äù ~ Carmen Giunta</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>Jira‚Äôs actually pretty great if you set it up correctly. The ninth circle of hell is trying to manage complex, interconnected projects across multiple teams with multiple milestones in GitHub issues and project boards. There‚Äôs a place for both.</em>‚Äù ~ Brandon Black</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>The intellect is presented with phenomena marching in review before the sensory organs. It can be truly useful and productive only when limiting itself to the modest tasks of observation, description, and comparison, and of classification that is based on analogies and differences. A knowledge of underlying causes and empirical laws will then come slowly through the use of inductive methods.</em>‚Äù ~ Ram√≥n y Cajal, Letters to a Young Investigator</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>Maybe this is why data mining has largely replaced traditional hypothesis-driven science. We are awash in small discoveries, most of which are essentially detections of ‚Äústatistically significant‚Äù patterns in big data. Usually, there is no unifying model or theory that generates predictions, testable or not. That would take too much time and thought. Even the elite scientific journals seem too favorable to observations of patterns in new data, even if irreproducible, possibly explained by chance, or utterly lacking any supporting theory. Except in a few areas, such as string theory and climate studies, there are few incentives to search for unifying principles, let alone large-scale models</em>‚Äù ~ PNA report</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>Perhaps the key to self-fulfillment is to unconsciously live consciously; But then perception is often reality. So the skillful scientist must wend the straight and narrow path between the fleeting perceptions of his character as arrogant and communicating his work in the most delicate way to carry as much people as possible along.</em>‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.</em>‚Äù ~ Feynman</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>What will the theories and technologies of 2065 look like? If we are not careful, if we do not sufficiently value explanatory science and individual creativity, they will look pretty much like they do today. But if we do, many wonders may lie ahead‚Äînot only the elusive unified field theory for physics but perhaps also a new type of ‚Äútheory‚Äù for cognition and consciousness, or maybe theories matching the scope and elegance of natural selection for other great challenges of biology, including the mechanisms of regulation and dysregulation (e.g., cancer and aging) at the cellular level and the prediction of structure and function at the molecular level.

<p>‚Äú<em>There are several ways in which a mathematician can
proceed to extend his research efforts, particularly one who
is deeply interested in problems arising from the physical
world. He can, on one hand, examine the equations he has
been working with and modify them in a variety of ways.
Or he can ask questions that have not been asked before
concerning the nature of the solution of the original equations.
This is basically a very difficult way to carry out
research. It is very easy to change the form of an equation
in a large number of ways. The great majority of the
new equations are not meaningful, and, in consequence,
lead to both difficult and unimportant problems. Similarly,
there are many questions that are difficult to answer, but
hardly worth asking. The well-trained mathematician does
not measure the value of a problem solely by its intractability.
The challenge is there, but even very small boys do not
accept all dares.</em>‚Äù

<p>‚Äú<em>In the study and practice of the sciences it is quite different; the false judgments we form neither affect our existence nor our welfare; and we are not forced by any physical necessity to correct them. Imagination, on the contrary, which is ever wandering beyond the bounds of truth, joined to self-love and that self-confidence we are so apt to indulge, prompt us to draw conclusions which are not immediately derived from facts; so that we become in some measure interested in deceiving ourselves. Hence it is by no means to be wondered, that, in the science of physics in general, men have often made suppositions, instead of forming conclusions. These suppositions, handed down from one age to another, acquire additional weight from the authorities by which they are supported, till at last they are received, even by men of genius, as fundamental truths.</em>‚Äù  ~ Lavoisier</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>Johnny von Neumann was a great mathematician and a great physicist.

  Two trains are 100 meters apart, moving towards each other. Each train is
  moving at 10 meters per second.  A bee is flying back and forth between those
  two trains at 20 meters per second. Eventually the bee will be squished when
  the two trains crash against each other. When they do, what will be the total
  distance flown by the bee? According to legend, von Neumann thought for a moment,
   and then said ‚Äú100 meters‚Äù. The questioner said, ‚ÄúCorrect. But now I know,
   from the quickness of your response, that you are really a physicist, not
   a mathematician.  The mathematician would have calculated when each bee-train
   encounter takes place, calculated the position, taken the sum of those distances
   as an infinite series, and then summed the series.  But a physicist would have
   taken a short-cut; the physicists would have realized that the bee was flying
   for 5 seconds at 20 meters per second, so it would have traveled 100 meters
   total. Von Neumann‚Äôs purported response: ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs a clever way to solve it!
