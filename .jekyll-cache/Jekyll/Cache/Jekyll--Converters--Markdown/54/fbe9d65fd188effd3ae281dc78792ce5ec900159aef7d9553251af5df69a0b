<h5 id="in-the-words-of-my-students"><strong>In the words of my students:</strong></h5>

<p><em>“Thank you again Lekan. [Taking RBOT 250 with you] was quite a journey. But I feel more confident now with ROS because I figured all of the ROS system. I’ll be looking forward to see you run the class again.”</em></p>

<p><em>“Dr. Molu is very caring about his students. I love how he makes time for me to run over course notes, point out helpful reading materials, and work through problems together with me. I enjoy the examples and exercises he tasks us with.”</em></p>

<p><em>“I want to thank Lekan for teaching this course, I definitely learned a lot. I am interested in auditing it when Lekan runs it again.”</em></p>
