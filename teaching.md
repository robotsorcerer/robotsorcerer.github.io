~~I mostly teach a mixture of undergrad and graduate level classes in Robotics at Brandeis.~~

I have left Brandeis.

This was a course I helped teach back in grad school to a mixture of Seniors and first-year ECE Masters students.The website I made in 2016 is highlighted below.

##### **In the words of my students:**

_"Thank you again Lekan. [Taking RBOT 250 with you] was quite a journey. But I feel more confident now with ROS because I figured all of the ROS system. I'll be looking forward to see you run the class again."_

_"Dr. Molu is very caring about his students. I love how he makes time for me to run over course notes, point out helpful reading materials, and work through problems together with me. I enjoy the examples and exercises he tasks us with."_

_"I want to thank Lekan for teaching this course, I definitely learned a lot. I am interested in auditing it when Lekan runs it again."_
