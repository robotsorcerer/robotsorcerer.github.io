I have left Brandeis.

#### A Short Treatise on Robots' Kinematic Geometry and Kinetics.

+ [Mechanisms and Screw Theory Slides](/downloads/Papers/screw_slides.pdf)
	+ Being a tutorial organized for the RL Group at MSR NYC. June, 2022. 


#### **RBOT250: The Mathematical Foundations of Robotics, Spring 2021.**

+ [Course Resource](/downloads/Papers/RBOT250.pdf)


#### **RBOT101: Robot Manipulation, Planning and Control, Spring 2020.**

+ [Course Resource](/downloads/Papers/RBOT101.pdf)

#### **EECS 4342: Introduction to Robotics, Fall 2016.**

This was a course I helped teach back in grad school to a mixture of Seniors and first-year ECE Masters students.The website I made in 2016 is highlighted below.

##### **In the words of my students:**

_"Thank you again Lekan. [Taking RBOT 250 with you] was quite a journey. But I feel more confident now with ROS because I figured all of the ROS system. I'll be looking forward to see you run the class again."_

_"Dr. Molu is very caring about his students. I love how he makes time for me to run over course notes, point out helpful reading materials, and work through problems together with me. I enjoy the examples and exercises he tasks us with."_

_"I want to thank Lekan for teaching this course, I definitely learned a lot. I am interested in auditing it when Lekan runs it again."_
