### **ICRA 2025 Workshop on Soft Robotics**

This page is the one-stop shop for all information regarding all workshop activities including invited speakers, panel debates, spotlight talks, the call for extended abstracts, and cutting- and bleeding-edge ideas that will engender the community of soft roboticists in reviving the (decade old) promise of embodied intelligence, realized via morphological computation, for robotic designs with adaptive motion strategies. This was originally envisioned by Helmut Hauser and colleagues a decade ago in their seminal [opinions and outlook on morphological computation](https://philpapers.org/rec/HAUOAO). See [Zambrano and colleagues](https://www.iris.sssup.it/handle/11382/461975)'s work for a more well-balanced and ballasted elucidation on using these schemes for robotic designs.

### **Abridgment**

**Embodied intelligence**, enabled by **morphological computation** in natural organisms, is the foundational principle that buoys the design, manufacture, model-based, and model-free control of soft robots [1]. This workshop will bring together researchers working at  the bleeding-edge of morphological computation as an embodied intelligence design principle for the build, precise mathematical- and learning-based characterization of the deformation and control of soft robots in everyday automation tasks.  Research themes will focus on **compositional designs for sensing and motor actuation efficacy**,  **reduced-order approximate mathematical models** for continuum bodies, **supervised and reinforced learning** models, **morphological computation for control** that tame the modeling complexity associated with continuums' complex kinematics or forward/inverse dynamics, and the **time-scale separation and layered architecture for (near) real-time control**. We will reiterate the **foundational vision of morphological computation for compliant bodies**, examine the state-of-the-art in their **design, control and modeling techniques**, highlight mission gaps so far, and <u>coalesce community efforts around the possibilities of compliant bodies’ morphological computation, not as problems, but rather as useful computational resources to be leveraged throughout the design, modeling, control, and motion execution process cycle</u>.

###  **Significance**

Natural organisms with embodied intelligence (EI) exploit their intrinsic morphological computation by integrating internal control computations with their structure for adaptive motion strategies. EI has inspired new design, modeling, and control paradigms in adaptive automation – yielding more improved robot automation mechanisms. In this design philosophy, rather than reject external disturbances and physical constraints, continuum soft robots must harness external forces and physical constraints for improved stiffness-to-weight ratio, bending, torsion, and twisting etc. However, most design, modeling, and control do not fully take advantage of these foundational principles. Novel mechanism designs are emerging given recent advances in material engineering. Even so, new kinematics, kinetics, and control methods for continuum robots are emerging. This workshop will bring researchers at the forefront of these important themes to disseminate recent findings and best practices to the robotics community. Aspiring towards the theoretical foundations of embodied intelligence [5, 7], we  will explore: (i) harnessing natural organisms’ EI in soft robots’ mechanism design; (ii) precise mathematical modeling tools  for predicting soft mechanisms behavior -- via ODE-based reduced-order finite dimensional control, and PDE-based control of continuum robots; (iii) emerging control methods for managing model complexity via robust and adaptive control; and (iv) the power of machine learning from sensory experimental data to model and control behavior. 

### 	**Motivation and Themes**

#### **Physical Design and Morphological Computation** 

Well-orchestrated as a design principle, EI can enable sophisticated reaching, morphing, grasping, growing, walking, crawling, swimming, or jumping motions that are useful in everyday assistive technologies, loco-manipulation, or navigation tasks. The first section of the workshop will involve speakers and practitioners leveraging EI philosophy in the design and fabrication of new chemical compounds and materials for soft robot mechanisms, reconfigurable and fiber-reinforced elastomeric continuum designs etc.

#### **Mathematical Modeling**

Since soft robots exhibit infinite degrees-of-freedom and distributed mass, when modeled exactly as a continuum body (nonlinear) partial differential equations (PDEs) are the standard mathematical modeling tools for analysis. However, scanty theory exists for nonlinear PDE analyses; and researchers have hitherto been utilizing approximate finite-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs) [3] as plausible alternative models. Recent efforts in the research community have demonstrated the power of reduced order and approximate finite-dimensional models undergoing finite elastic deformations including piecewise constant strain, constant curvature and variable strain models. For large deformations, variable curvature models based on elliptic integrals or Cosserat theory are becoming more effective in modeling nonlinear elastic deformation models that yield accurate results. The modeling section of this workshop will feature researchers working on these emerging models to disseminate the latest advances with these modeling tools.

#### **ML-based Modeling**

While mathematical tools often come in handy for executing precise behaviors on soft robots, they are often not readily available, often  difficult to develop, or the practicing engineer may not have the skillset to derive a closed-form model. Machine learning is now widely accepted as a modeling means for various cyberphysical systems. For the complex internal dynamics of a soft robot to match the physical interactions of the external environment, the question is not whether machine learning (ML) should be incorporated into soft robotic systems but how? The ML-based modeling section of the workshop will consider empirical approximation models of the soft robot that enables learning the forward and inverse causal dynamics from inputs to states to outputs and vice versa. 
We will have sessions that focus on supervised learning approaches for modeling the forward dynamics of soft robots. For non-convex datasets gathered experimentally from the soft robot’s dynamics, we will explore learning inverse dynamics models from actuator to configuration space dynamics, and from configuration to task space dynamics. In addition, given the recent model-free, on-policy, and off-policy reinforcement learning advances, we will explore their efficacy in learning model and control strategies for soft robots and how they adopt EI as a design principle in determining compliant response to external stimuli. 

#### **Control of Soft Robots**

Soft robot control techniques abound from model-based designs [3, 4] on reduced-order finite-dimensional models [4], PDE-based control, to learning-based control approaches [5]. In their control applications alone, the number of publications in soft robotics has witnessed a meteoric rise from a measly 104 in 2012 to 2,358 publications in 2021 [5]. We will take an all-of-the-above strategy in exploring the control schemes that have found success stories in physical applications so far. Themes under consideration include but are not limited to fractional-order calculus-based methods, reduced-order approximate ODE models, Cosserat models, constant curvature and constant strain optimal. Adaptive, and learning-based control methods among others.


#### **Speakers**

We have strived for inclusivity in speakers from diverse academic backgrounds, thoughgt-leadership, geography, demographics, career stages, and gender across academia and industry. We have honed our focus in particular on speakers that have high-impact work in the research community -- prominent examples include Professors Federico Renda, Carmel Majidi, Monje Micharet, and Fumiya Lida.

### **Format**

We propose an exciting workshop with audience participation engaged via panel debates amongst key speakers; intentional diversity of high-profile speakers that cut across gender, race, geography, industry, and academe. This will draw a well-balanced and ballasted participation from the robotics and automation society, bringing representation of women and underrepresented members of the community together as we catalyze interest in our proposed themes. A hybrid mode meeting option (in-person and online) with contemporary interactive software tools including Teams and Gather.Town will help engage online registered participants and speakers who cannot travel in person; we will coordinate extensively with the ICRA organizers audio-visual team so that we have a seamless delivery of content to the hybrid audience/participants. 
A technical portion of the program shall be discharged by the organizers highlighting the current state-of-the-art with respect to soft robots’ embodied intelligence, new advances in physical materials that enable improved designs, numerical algorithms and benchmarks for computational models and control.  Each speaker’s talk on topics will be followed by a Q&A round to encourage discussion. There will be solicitation for workshop paper submissions in the form of extended abstracts prior to the conference. We will leverage mediums such as robotics worldwide email lists, x.com, and other impactful media campaigns for high visibility to engender broad participation and engagement. Spotlight talks drawn from the best workshop abstract submissions will garner engaging participation from attendees and a poster session for other runner-up accepted abstracts will facilitate possible future collaborations among attendees. We will live stream the workshop using YouTube live streaming, with public access to those with the link. To avoid fatigue and facilitate a rich exchange of information and ideas, we propose interactive activities in breakout sessions, and ten-minute tea breaks before the top of every hour of the workshop.


#### **Panel Debate**

Our workshop will consist of 2x 45-minutes debate sessions involving 3 speakers from our organizers list. The topics of the debate along with the participating speakers are provided in Table I.
Plan to Solicit Participation
