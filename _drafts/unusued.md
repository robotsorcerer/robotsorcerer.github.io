<b>Engineer-scientist</b> hybrid across the physical and virtual automation stack --- comprising the algorithmic theory and practice of AI, RL, ML, and Control systems on automatons and robot (soft, semi-rigid, and rigid) mechanisms (including their (constrained) [configuration](/downloads/Papers/RBOT101.pdf), control, and [kinematic/kinetic analyses](/downloads/Papers/screw_slides.pdf)) --- and their applications to virtual and physical automatons. Currently, a Senior Researcher within the Machine Learning group at Microsoft Research Core -- New York City, Lekan's research efforts span the complete ideation gamut from conceptualization, rigorous theoretical analysis, to abundant empirical and embodied proof-of-concept on real-world physical systems. **Robotics:** Lekan has made fundamental contributions to (i) [configuration design, modeling, control, and trajectory optimization on _parallel and soft_ robot mechanisms](https://www.med.upenn.edu/wiersmalab/) with applications to head-and-neck cancer [patient treatment planning](http://scriptedonachip.com/downloads/Papers/kinecontrol.pdf); (ii) [understanding the fundmental mathematical modeling](/downloads/Papers/SoRoPD.pdf) blocks of soft robotic systems; and (iii) devised fast control principles for the [whole-body strain and twist regulation of soft, deformable robots](/downloads/Papers/SoRoSPT.pdf) --- inspired by [his previous efforts in their applications to head and neck coplanar cancer radiation therapy](/downloads/Papers/ContinuumI.pdf). **Reinforcement learning (RL):** He has contributed to (iv) [RL state representation theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08229.pdf); and has made (v) [novel RL translational research impact in the fractionated cancer radiation patient treatment planning scheme](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1118/1.4924100). **Machine Learning:** Not too long ago, hemmed in by the delayed rewards associated with RL, along with his colleagues they explored (vi) [the theory behind agentic systems that learn instanteneously via interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08364). **Contemporary Computational Control:** Lately, understanding full-well the fragility of continuous-time, Bellman-optimized deep policies, he has made fundamental contributions to robust (vii) [policy optimization](downloads/Papers/h2hinf.pdf) in complete (viii) [data-driven settings](downloads/Papers/ifac.pdf) and recently released a (ix) [scalable GPU-accelerated library for the numerical computation of safety certificates](/downloads/Papers/levelsetpy.pdf) when (x) [controlling large-scale dynamical systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07308.pdf). **Old-school ML/Control:** Before multimodal learning was cool, at Amazon Fulfillment Technlogies in North Reading, MA, he was part of the team that (xi) orchestrated a full-stack navigation system on the Pioneer Clearpath P3-DX mobile robot based on [Alexa's Echo](https://www.amazon.com/b/?node=9818047011&ref_=mars_byline_aucc_branded) voice commands and pixel-based navigation. A while ago, in Tokyo, he explored (xii) [learned nonlinear controllers via human imitation](https://github.com/robotsorcerer/LyapunovLearner) on the [Torobo anthropomorphic robot arm](https://robotics.tokyo/products/torobo/). These days, when Lekan is among his friends, they ask one another, **"how do we tame Diffusion models in a principled stochastic optimal control manner?"** or **["what efficient numerical algorithms can we devise for agentic systems](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-ai-vs-generative-ai)** tasked with dexterous manipulation or autonomous navigation based on [multimodal sensing in unstructured, open-embodiments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20020)?" (What a hard-knock life!) 

Among other [service activities](#service) within and without MSFT, Lekan is a part of the robotics steering committee out of the [embodied AI research efforts](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/collaboration/embodied-ai/people/) within the various cross-geographic teams throughout MSFT; he strongly believes in giving back to the [research community, often mentoring junior researchers](#mentor); he helped seed the current MSFT-wide Cortex seminar series out of a narrow RL research niche within the real-world RL team at MSR to a company-wide appeal within MSFT. Lekan is active in the machine learning, IEEE Control Systems, and IEEE Robotics and Automation Societies. The questions that keep Lekan up at night can be found on his [research page](/research). Well then you ask, "is Lekan a research scientist or an Engineer?" Day of the week and the problem-at-hand --- if he's not in a parallel universe day-drinking or on his bike.

PS: Lekan Molu (he/him) is the double diminutive of Olalekan Ogunmolu, his full legal name. He would rather be addressed as Lekan Molu (pronounced **Lay-con Moh-loo**) in all professional and informal settings. You are welcome! (This intro is proudly not written by an AI or a robot!).
