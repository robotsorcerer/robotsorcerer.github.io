- **Emergent embodied intelligence** via morphological computation in physically adaptible and reactive robotic systems (including soft robots and deformables): finite reduced-order, fractional, and learned models, ode- and pde-based control, time-scale separation of heterogeneous dynamics, and layered control.<br>
- **Machine learning (read: optimization) in control and planning**: Self-aware, situationally-aware systems (e.g. physical robots, augmented, and virtual reality agents) that self-organize by systemic constraints (read: not imposed objectives).
- **Safety in decision-making**: HJ equations, and constrained numerical algorithms.

<b>Full-stack, innovation-oriented roboticist</b> (rigid, semi-rigid, and soft) -- mechanism design, (constrained) [configuration](/downloads/Papers/RBOT101.pdf) and [kinematic analysis](/downloads/Papers/screw_slides.pdf), and [AI/ML stack](downloads/Papers/IROS18.pdf). Algorithmics expertise encompassing the theory and practice of the AI, ML, and Control automation stack in virtual and physical automatons. Currently, a Senior Researcher within the Machine Learning group at Microsoft Research Core -- New York City. Research efforts span the complete ideation gamut from conceptualization, rigorous theoretical analysis, to abundant empirical and embodied proof-of-concept on real-world physical systems: Lekan has worked on (i) [understanding the fundmental modeling](/downloads/Papers/SoRoPD.pdf) blocks and devising principles for the [fast whole-body layered control of soft, deformable robots](/downloads/Papers/SoRoSPT.pdf) -- inpired by [his previous efforts in their applications to head and neck coplanar cancer radiation therapy](/downloads/Papers/ContinuumI.pdf); (ii) [RL state representation theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08229.pdf); (iii) the role of [RL in the fractionated cancer radiation patient treatment planning stack](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1118/1.4924100). Not too long ago, hemmed in by the delayed rewards associated with RL, with his colleagues they were concerned with (iv) [the theory behind agentic systems that learn instanteneously via interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08364); and encumbered by safety of learned Bellman-like policies deployed in hazardous environments, he recently contributed a (v) [the scalable library for the numerical computation of safety certificates](/downloads/Papers/levelsetpy.pdf) when [controlling large-scale dynamical systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07308.pdf). Before multimodal learning was cool, at Amazon Fulfillment Technlogies, he orchestrated a full-stack navigation system on the Pioneer P3-DX robot based on [Alexa's Echo](https://www.amazon.com/b/?node=9818047011&ref_=mars_byline_aucc_branded) voice commands and pixel-based navigation. Before behavior cloning became cool, he explored [learned nonlinear controllers via human imitation](https://github.com/robotsorcerer/LyapunovLearner) on the [Torobo anthropomorphic robot arm](https://robotics.tokyo/products/torobo/), based on dynamical systems and Lyapunov analysis. These days, when Lekan is among his friends, they ask one another ["how do we create efficient numerical algorithms  for agentic systems](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-ai-vs-generative-ai) tasked with autonomous navigation and dexterous manipulation within [multimodal, unstructured, non-localized open-embodiments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20020)"? What a hard-knock life! Among other service activities within and without MSFT, Lekan is a part of the robotics steering committee out of the [embodied AI research efforts](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/collaboration/embodied-ai/people/) within the various cross-geographic teams throughout the company; he helped seed the current Cortex seminar series from a narrow RL research focus to a company-wide appeal within MSFT. Lekan is active in the machine learning, IEEE Control Systems, and IEEE Robotics and Automation Societies. The questions that keep Lekan up at night can be found on his [research page](/research). So is Lekan a research scientist or an Engineer? Day of the week and the problem-at-hand, if you ask him.

PS: Lekan Molu is the double diminutive form of Olalekan Ogunmolu, my full legal name. I prefer to go by Lekan Molu in all professional and informal settings. You are welcome!
