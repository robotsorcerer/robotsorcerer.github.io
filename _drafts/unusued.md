<b>Engineer-scientist</b> hybrid across the physical and virtual automation stack --- comprising the algorithmic theory and practice of AI, RL, ML, and Control systems on automatons with emphasis on robot mechanisms ---  [kinematic/kinetic](/downloads/Papers/screw_slides.pdf)/[(constrained)configuration](/downloads/Papers/RBOT250.pdf) analyses. Lekan's research efforts span the complete ideation gamut from [conceptualization](downloads/Papers/kinecontrol.pdf), [rigorous theoretical analysis](downloads/Papers/h2hinf.pdf), to abundant [empirical](downloads/Papers/levelsetpy.pdf) and embodied proof-of-concept on [real-world physical systems](downloads/Papers/PCLAST.pdf). **Robotics:** Lekan has made fundamental contributions to (i) [configuration design, modeling, control, and trajectory optimization on _parallel and soft_ robot mechanisms](https://www.med.upenn.edu/wiersmalab/) with applications to head-and-neck cancer [patient treatment planning](http://scriptedonachip.com/downloads/Papers/kinecontrol.pdf); (ii) [understanding the fundmental mathematical modeling](/downloads/Papers/SoRoPD.pdf) blocks of soft robotic systems; and (iii) devised fast control principles for the [whole-body strain and twist regulation of soft, deformable robots](/downloads/Papers/SoRoSPT.pdf) --- inspired by [his previous efforts in their applications to head and neck coplanar cancer radiation therapy](/downloads/Papers/ContinuumI.pdf). **Reinforcement learning (RL):** He has contributed to (iv) [RL state representation theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08229.pdf); and has made (v) [novel RL translational research impact in the fractionated cancer radiation patient treatment planning scheme](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1118/1.4924100). **Machine Learning:** Not too long ago, hemmed in by the delayed rewards associated with RL, along with his colleagues they explored (vi) [the theory behind agentic systems that learn instanteneously via interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08364). **Contemporary Computational Control:** Lately, understanding full-well the fragility of continuous-time, Bellman-optimized deep policies, he has made fundamental contributions to robust (vii) [policy optimization](downloads/Papers/h2hinf.pdf) in complete (viii) [data-driven settings](downloads/Papers/ifac.pdf) and recently released a (ix) [scalable GPU-accelerated library for the numerical computation of safety certificates](/downloads/Papers/levelsetpy.pdf) when (x) [controlling large-scale dynamical systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07308.pdf). **Old-school ML/Control:** Before multimodal learning was cool, at Amazon Fulfillment Technlogies in North Reading, MA, he was part of the team that (xi) orchestrated a full-stack navigation system on the Pioneer Clearpath P3-DX mobile robot based on [Alexa's Echo](https://www.amazon.com/b/?node=9818047011&ref_=mars_byline_aucc_branded) voice commands and pixel-based navigation. A while ago, in Tokyo, he explored (xii) [learned nonlinear controllers via human imitation](https://github.com/robotsorcerer/LyapunovLearner) on the [Torobo anthropomorphic robot arm](https://robotics.tokyo/products/torobo/).

Among other [service activities](#service) within and without MSFT, Lekan is a part of the robotics steering committee out of the [embodied AI research efforts](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/collaboration/embodied-ai/people/) within the various cross-geographic teams throughout MSFT; he strongly believes in giving back to the [research community, often mentoring junior researchers](#mentor); he helped seed the current MSFT-wide Cortex seminar series out of a narrow RL research niche within the real-world RL team at MSR to a company-wide appeal within MSFT. Lekan is active in the machine learning, IEEE Control Systems, and IEEE Robotics and Automation Societies. 

In the quest for balance in his devotion to robots, learning, control, and other life pursuits, work-life balance has become an interesting paradox: to have one, one cannot discard the other. He has not always found a balance every time, but he has learned to enjoy the chaotic dynamics that work-life balance presents.

-----Life Update-----

As those close to me already know, I was affected by the last round of layoffs at Microsoft Research, writ Microsoft at large. It's been a frantic two months of trying to land on my two feet after this abrupt destabilization. Glad for this  option that came along and I am all for it. It is laden with simple things like the right team, the right fit, wonderful colleagues, and a great location. Benefits includes perks like doing things I love, engineering control into physical automatons, and innovating embodied agentic AI on real-world physical robots. Because every engineer needs a place of quiet repose to make automatons that slap harder than a kernel panic at 99% uptime! Here's to many years of productive collaboration with key partners and many moments of fantastic innovation. This already awesome team is about to get even more snazzy with robots that drip copious amounts of swagger!

**üöÄ Life Update**

As many of you know, I was affected by the recent wave of layoffs at Microsoft Research. The past two months have been a whirlwind‚Äînavigating the unexpected, finding balance, and figuring out what's next.

I'm thrilled to share that I've landed somewhere that checks all the right boxes: brilliant colleagues, the right cultural fit, a mission I believe in, and yes‚Äîrobots. Lots of them.

I'll be working on embodied, agentic AI systems, bringing real-world physical robots to life in ways that are useful, expressive, and just a little bit swaggerlicious. This means engineering control into automatons that (in classic Linux fashion) slap harder than a kernel panic at 99% uptime.

Here‚Äôs to building something great‚Äîtogether.

üîß Life Update
Like many others, I was affected by the recent round of layoffs at Microsoft Research. It‚Äôs been a whirlwind couple of months‚Äînavigating uncertainty, reconnecting with my network, and considering what I truly want next.

I‚Äôm happy to share that I‚Äôve found that next chapter‚Äîand it feels like the right one. A great team. A strong fit. A mission I believe in. And the chance to keep building systems I care deeply about: real-world robots powered by embodied, agentic AI.

I'll be focused on engineering intelligence into physical systems‚Äîdesigning control algorithms, exploring representation learning, and helping push forward the frontier of AI for physical agents. Put differently: building robots that work and wow.

Excited for what‚Äôs ahead‚Äîwith partners I admire, problems that matter, and a chance to keep learning and building.

with emphasis on robot mechanisms. 
The case for reinventing robot intelligence: Control theory should be a tool; not a religion. Bring all the control formal guarantees. But don‚Äôt discard our showy-engineer traditions. Building AI models for stable+safe robot skills, allowing generalization across tasks that border on ambitious and the ledge of ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù prototypes that push mechanical and control limits --- from simulation to hardware that kick up dusts.
